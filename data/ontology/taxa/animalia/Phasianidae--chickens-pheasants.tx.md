Phasianids are versatile: quick-cooking white meat (breast), richer dark meat (thigh/legs), skin-on roasts, and bone-in stocks yielding gelatin. Nutrition leans toward efficient protein with niacin, B6, selenium, and phosphorus; dark meat carries slightly more iron and zinc than breast. Brining enhances juiciness but elevates sodium; skin increases fat and energy density while improving texture. Eggs offer complete protein, choline, and fat-soluble vitamins; handling and storage practices strongly affect safety. Flavor varies with age, feed, and activity (e.g., heritage vs conventional birds). Cross-contamination control and thorough cooking are critical in home and commercial kitchens.
