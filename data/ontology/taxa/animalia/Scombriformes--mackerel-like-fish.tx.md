summary: Oily, fast-swimming fish (mackerel, tuna, bonito) with very high EPA/DHA and complete protein; watch histamine risk from mishandling and mercury in larger species.

Scombriform fish are nutrient-dense, combining robust protein with high omega-3s (EPA/DHA). They're flavorful and satiating due to higher fat; vitamin D can be notable in some species. Larger, long-lived fish (e.g., big tunas, king mackerel) may accumulate more mercuryâ€”serving frequency guidance is species/size dependent. Because these fish are prone to histamine formation when temperature-abused, strict cold-chain handling is important. Canned tuna offers convenience with variable sodium; choosing styles packed in water or olive oil shifts calories and fat profile.
