summary: Protein-dense animal foods with complete amino acids; fat varies by species/cut; key sources of heme iron, vitamin B12, zinc, creatine/carnosine, and (in many fish) long-chain omega-3s.

Chordates (mammals, birds, fish, etc.) are generally high-protein foods with complete amino acid profiles. Fat ranges from very lean (white fish, poultry breast) to rich (fatty fish, marbled red meat, skin-on poultry), shifting energy density and fatty-acid mix. Micronutrient standouts include vitamin B12 and heme iron (especially in red meats and many fish), zinc, selenium, and bioactive compounds like creatine, carnosine, and taurine. Fatty fish contribute EPA/DHA and often vitamin D; edible bones (e.g., small canned fish) add calcium. Main risks are species-specific (parasites, histamine/mercury in some fish, handling/cooking safety).
