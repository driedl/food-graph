Gadiformes are classic "white fish" used for fillets and flakes. They deliver a lot of protein with minimal fat, making them low-calorie and broadly adaptable. Omega-3 levels are present but lower than in oily fish; minerals like iodine and selenium are reliable strengths. Vitamin D is modest unless fortified or from liver oil. Their delicate texture suits gentle heat; battered/fried preps add substantial calories. Usual seafood safety guidance applies (freshness, proper chill, thorough cooking or validated freezing for raw uses).
