Gadids excel in preparations that respect delicate flakes—baking, poaching, steaming, light frying—and in salt-cured traditions that transform texture and shelf life. They provide substantial protein with low fat, reliable iodine and selenium, and modest omega-3s relative to oily fish. Liver oils historically served as vitamin D and omega-3 sources. Breaded/fried products raise calories and sodium; gentle cooking maintains succulence. Freshness and proper chilling protect against spoilage and off-odors. Sustainability and catch area affect flavor and moisture; frozen-at-sea fillets can rival fresh quality.
