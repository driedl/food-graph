Shrimp are quick-cooking and versatile in stir-fries, grills, boils, and tempura; shells and heads create deeply flavored stocks. They provide lean protein with iodine, selenium, copper, zinc, B12, and choline; pigments like astaxanthin concentrate in shells/roe. Cholesterol per 100 g is comparatively high, though overall fat is low. Processing (brining, phosphate treatment) can increase sodium and alter textureâ€”labels matter. Shellfish allergy is common; cross-contact controls are essential. Size grades, farming conditions, and freezing practices drive quality; rapid IQF often preserves texture best.
