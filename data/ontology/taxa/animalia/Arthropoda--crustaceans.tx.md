summary: Crustaceans are high-protein, low-fat, iodine- and selenium-rich foods whose chitinous shells affect texture and can add fiber.

Crustaceans (shrimp, crabs) are high-protein, usually low-fat foods with distinctive mineral profiles (iodine, zinc, copper, selenium). Cholesterol can be relatively high despite low total fat. The chitinous exoskeleton contributes indigestible fiber components (when eaten, e.g., in some shell preparations) and informs texture and cooking behavior. As users branch into families and genera, expect subtle differences driven by habitat and diet more than big macro swings.
