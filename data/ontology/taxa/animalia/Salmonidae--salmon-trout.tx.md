Salmonids support grilling, roasting, curing, and smoking thanks to firmer texture and flavorful fat. They supply complete protein, abundant long-chain omega-3s (EPA/DHA), and frequently vitamin D; skin adds collagen and fat, while canned bone-in fish contribute calcium. Wild versus farmed origins, diet, and specific species drive fat content and flavor intensity. Overcooking quickly dries leaner portions; gentle heat maintains tenderness. Parasite management (freezing for raw applications) and careful cold-chain are important. Smoked and cured products are convenient but often high in sodiumâ€”child nodes can reflect style-specific tradeoffs.
