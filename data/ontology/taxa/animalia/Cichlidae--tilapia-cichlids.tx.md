Cichlids offer accessible flavor for pan-searing, baking, and steaming; neutral taste welcomes sauces and spice blends. Nutrition features ample protein with low to moderate fat; B12 and selenium are typical strengths, while omega-3s depend on feed. Farming conditions (stocking density, diet, water quality) influence texture, fat, and trace mineralsâ€”producer metadata can help downstream quality filters. Breaded/fried formats add calories and sodium; plain fillets keep totals modest. Proper chilling is essential; these fillets are prone to drying when overcooked. Many regional species exist beyond tilapia, with localized culinary roles.
