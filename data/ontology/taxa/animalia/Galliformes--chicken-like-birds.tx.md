Galliform birds provide versatile, generally lean protein with favorable calorie-to-protein ratios. Skinless breast is very lean; thighs/skin increase fat and flavor. Typical micronutrient strengths include niacin (B3), vitamin B6, selenium, and phosphorus; iron is present but less concentrated than in red meats. Dark meat has slightly more iron, zinc, and myoglobin than white meat. Broths made from bones/feet supply collagen/gelatin. Watch for sodium in brined or processed products and handle poultry carefully for food safety.
