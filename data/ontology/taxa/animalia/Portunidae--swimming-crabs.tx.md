Portunid crabs yield delicate, sweet meat from claws and bodies, commonly sold pasteurized or fresh; picking skill affects yield and shell fragments. Nutrition highlights include lean protein with B12, copper, zinc, and selenium; roe/tomalley are richer but also concentrate contaminants more readily. Shells and bodies produce collagen- and mineral-rich stocks and sauces. Allergy risk mirrors other crustaceans. Sodium content can rise in brined/pasteurized products; check labels. Seasonality, molt stage, and handling influence meat fullness and flavor, which child nodes can refine by species and fishery.
