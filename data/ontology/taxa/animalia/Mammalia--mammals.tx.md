summary: Red meats and dairy dominate, with higher myoglobin and heme iron in meats and calcium-rich casein/whey in milk.

Mammals contribute red meats and milk. Red meats trend higher in myoglobin and heme iron; fat profiles vary with species and feed (ruminants more saturated, pasture can raise omega-3 a bit). Dairy introduces lactose, complete proteins (casein/whey), and bioavailable calcium with fat-soluble vitamins tracking milk-fat percentage. Organ meats are micronutrient outliers (vitamin A, B-complex, iron), while muscle meats are protein-dense with creatine and carnosine.
