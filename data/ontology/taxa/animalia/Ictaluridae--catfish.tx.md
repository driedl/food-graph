Ictalurid fillets cook quickly and pair well with crispy coatings or gentle poaching. They provide strong protein with generally modest fat; omega-3 content trails oily fish but is present. Farming water quality and feed shape fatty-acid composition and mineral profile; wild fish reflect habitat. Blackening, frying, and étouffée-style dishes are classic but can spike calories; grilled or baked options keep totals lower. Sensory quality depends on freshness and muddy off-flavor control (purging, clean holding). Bones and heads are useful for stock in traditional cuisines.
