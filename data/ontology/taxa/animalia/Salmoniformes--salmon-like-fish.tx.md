Salmonids are prized for long-chain omega-3s (EPA/DHA) and frequently meaningful vitamin D, alongside complete protein. Fat content is higher than in lean fish, improving satiety and mouthfeel; skin contains additional fat and collagen. The characteristic color reflects carotenoids (e.g., astaxanthin). Canned salmon with bones contributes bioavailable calcium. Flavor tolerates grilling, roasting, curing, and smoking; be mindful of added sodium in smoked products. Standard guidance on parasites and proper handling/freezing applies.
