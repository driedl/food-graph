Decapods are the primary edible crustaceans. Muscle meat is very lean yet flavorful, delivering ample protein with few calories. Micronutrient highlights include iodine, selenium, copper, zinc, B12, and choline; carotenoids (astaxanthin) and minerals concentrate in shells/heads (often used for stocks). Cholesterol is relatively high per serving. Allergen prevalence is significant, so labeling and cross-contact controls matter. Sodium varies with processing (brines, phosphates). As with all seafood, freshness and proper cooking are key for safety and texture.
