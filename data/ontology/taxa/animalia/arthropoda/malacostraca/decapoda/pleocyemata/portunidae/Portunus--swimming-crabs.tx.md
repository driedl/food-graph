_Culinary scope & forms._ Whole steamed crabs, wok-fried crabs in sauces, and picked meat in cakes and salads dominate. Pasteurized cans extend shelf life with mild flavor loss; shells and bodies build bisques and broths.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Claw meat is firmer; body meat is delicate and sweet. Gentle heat preserves tenderness; overcooking dries picked meat quickly. Cracking while hot eases picking and yield.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Lean, high-protein meat with mineral strengths like zinc, copper, and selenium; roe is richer and more intense. Flavor is clean-sweet with saline notes.

_Safety & handling._ As with other crustaceans, allergen risk is significant. Pasteurized meat still requires refrigeration. Shell fragments are a quality concern; careful picking matters. Keep live product cool and moist; cook promptly.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Species, molt stage, and habitat drive fullness and sweetness. Pasteurized product travels well; fresh offers brighter flavor. Store picked meat cold and use quickly; shells freeze well for stock.
