_Culinary scope & forms._ This node covers market prawns handled as head-on or head-off, peeled or shell-on, and sold fresh, frozen IQF, or pre-cooked. Shells and heads flavor broths and sauces; roe and hepatopancreas enrich bisques. Quick-cook techniques predominate: sauté, wok-sear, grill, poach, boil, or deep-fry; brines or dry salt improve snap and seasoning.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Flesh turns opaque and curls with heat; brief, high heat keeps juiciness, while overcooking toughens and squeezes out moisture. Shell-on cooking protects surface and concentrates aroma; head-on basting adds sweetness and fat. Butterfly cuts aid even cooking and seasoning pickup.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Typical patterns include lean protein with low total fat; shell pigments like astaxanthin intensify color and flavor when cooked. Minerals such as iodine and selenium are characteristic, varying by habitat and feed.

_Safety & handling._ Shellfish allergy is common; cross-contact controls matter. Phosphate treatments increase water retention and sodium; labels help. Keep very cold; thaw gently; avoid mushiness from refreezing. Devein if gritty sand lines detract from texture.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Species, size grade, habitat, and farming practices drive flavor and firmness. Frozen-at-sea IQF often rivals "fresh." Store at 0–2 °C and cook quickly; shells and heads freeze well for stocks. Sustainability certifications and country-of-origin inform sourcing choices.
