_Culinary scope & forms._ Common formats include head-off peeled raw, shell-on for grills, and pre-cooked cocktail styles. Shells and heads enrich stocks; quick marinades and dry brines improve seasoning and snap. Suit stir-fries, skewers, and tempura.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Cook just to opaque and firm; overcooking tightens and weeps. Shell-on protects moisture and adds aroma; butterflying aids even heat and sauce pickup. Salty ice slurries chill fast post-cook.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Generally lean, high in protein with carotenoid pigments concentrating in shells; mineral profile reflects feed and waters. Overall fat is low; flavor intensity is mild-sweet.

_Safety & handling._ Allergen risk is high; avoid cross-contact. Phosphate-treated lots hold more water and sodium. Keep very cold; thaw gently under refrigeration to preserve texture.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Farm practices and feed shape flavor and firmness; wild captures vary seasonally. IQF quality is often excellent. Store near 0–2 °C and cook soon after thaw; freeze shells for stock.
