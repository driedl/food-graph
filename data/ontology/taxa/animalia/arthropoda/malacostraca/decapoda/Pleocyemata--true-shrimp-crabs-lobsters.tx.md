_Culinary scope & forms._ This node spans claw- and tail-centric species (lobsters, crayfish), swimming and burrowing crabs for picked meat, and true shrimp for quick saut√©s. Whole specimens yield roasted shells, stocks, and sauces; prepared formats include pasteurized crab, lobster tails, and peeled shrimp.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Claw and tail meats favor gentle moist heat or precise high heat to keep springiness; picked crab dries easily and prefers minimal reheating. Shell-on cooking preserves moisture and aroma; cracking and butter basting accentuate sweetness. Overcooking toughens quickly.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ These foods typically provide dense protein with low to moderate fat, mineral strengths like copper, zinc, and selenium, and carotenoid pigments in shells. Roe and tomalley are richer and more intense in flavor.

_Safety & handling._ Allergen prevalence is significant; maintain strict segregation. Pasteurized crab needs refrigeration despite long shelf life. Temperature abuse in shrimp leads to off-odors; live storage and humane dispatch matter for lobsters/crabs. Shell fragments are a quality control point.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Species, molt stage, and habitat influence meat fullness and sweetness. Wild vs farmed shrimp, pot vs trawl crabs, and cold vs warm waters shape flavor. Keep raw products very cold; cook or pasteurize for extended holding; freeze stocks for later use.
