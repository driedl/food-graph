Bovid foods span fresh cuts, slow-cooked collagen-rich portions, rendered fats, and a vast dairy spectrum (milk, cultured milks, cheeses, butter, ghee). Nutritionally they deliver complete protein, B12, heme iron, zinc, and selenium; fat level, fatty-acid mix (e.g., stearic acid, CLA in ruminants), and energy density vary by species, breed, feed, and cut. Offal concentrates micronutrients and unique compounds but has strong flavors; bones/skins yield gelatin and stock. Processing (aging, curing, smoking) changes texture, flavor, and sodium substantially. Food-safety hinges on cold-chain, doneness, and cross-contamination control. Environmental and ethical attributes (grass- vs grain-finishing, husbandry) influence flavor and fat profile, which your downstream nodes can express.
