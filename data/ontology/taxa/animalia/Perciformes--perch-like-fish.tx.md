Perciformes is a large, diverse order covering many market fish. Most table species are lean to moderately fatty, offering high protein with modest calories and a mild to medium flavor. Selenium and vitamin B12 are common strengths; omega-3 content varies by species and diet, generally below salmonids but not negligible. Farming practices influence fat composition and micronutrients. As with other fish, freshness and proper cold chain matter; some larger predators within the order may accumulate more contaminants than small, short-lived species.
