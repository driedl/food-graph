Even-toed ungulates include major meat species (cattle, sheep, goats, deer) and pork. Nutrition centers on high-quality protein with abundant B12, heme iron, zinc, and selenium. Fat content and fatty-acid profile varyâ€”marbling raises energy density; ruminant fat is relatively rich in stearic acid and contains conjugated linoleic acid (CLA); pork tends to have higher MUFA. Organ meats are nutrient-dense (A, B-complex, iron) but strong-flavored. Collagen-rich cuts offer glycine and gelatin when slow-cooked. Consider trim/processing (sodium, cured meats) and doneness/food-safety practices.
