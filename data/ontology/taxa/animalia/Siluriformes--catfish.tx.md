Catfish provide accessible, mild fillets that cook quickly. They are protein-rich with generally low to moderate fat; omega-3s are present but lower than in salmon or mackerel. B12 and selenium are typical positives. Farmed products dominate in many markets; feed and water quality shape fatty-acid profiles and trace minerals, so values can vary by producer. Breaded/fried formats add significant fat and sodium—plain fillets keep calories lower.
