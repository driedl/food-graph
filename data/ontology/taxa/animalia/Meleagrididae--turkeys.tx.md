Turkey emphasizes high protein per calorie in skinless cuts while retaining richer options in thighs/skin-on roasts. It typically delivers niacin, B6, selenium, and modest iron; fat and sodium rise in processed slices and brined birds. Mechanical deboning and forming enable patties and deli meat; labels help track additives. Whole carcasses yield ample bones, necks, and giblets for stock; drippings can be clarified or reduced. As with other poultry, strict cold-chain and internal-temperature targets (especially for large roasts) mitigate risk. Wild turkeys tend to be leaner and more intensely flavored, affecting cooking methods.
