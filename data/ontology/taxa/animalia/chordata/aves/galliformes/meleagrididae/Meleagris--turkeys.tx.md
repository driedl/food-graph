_Culinary scope & forms._ Whole birds roast or smoke; parts grill or braise; ground meat makes burgers and sauces. Bones and skin yield gelatin-rich stocks; drippings form pan sauces.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Breast dries quickly and benefits from brining or precise cooking; thighs and legs tolerate longer, moister heat. Resting improves juiciness; slicing across grain helps tenderness.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Lean, protein-dense cuts contrast with richer skin-on dark meat. Typical micronutrients include niacin and selenium; flavor varies with age and diet.

_Safety & handling._ Strict cross-contamination control and doneness targets are essential. Deli forms vary in sodium; check labels. Thaw large birds safely under refrigeration.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Heritage and wild birds are leaner and more flavorful; commercial birds often brined. Store cold; cook promptly; freeze portions to extend use.
