_Culinary scope & forms._ From whole birds to breasts, thighs, wings, and ground, formats cover nearly every method. Bones and feet enrich broths; eggs serve as standalone foods and functional ingredients.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Skin crisps under high heat; breasts prefer precise temps; thighs handle stews and curries. Brines and marinades enhance juiciness and flavor.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Efficient protein with modest fat in skinless cuts; dark meat brings richer taste. Eggs offer fat-protein emulsions and versatile structure.

_Safety & handling._ Cross-contamination control is critical; cook ground forms through. Brined and processed products can be sodium-heavy; monitor seasoning.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Breed, feed, and age shape flavor and fatness. Store cold; cook promptly; freeze portions; keep eggs chilled and intact.
