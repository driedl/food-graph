_Culinary scope & forms._ Chops and racks grill; legs roast; shoulders braise; ground lamb anchors kebabs. Milks become yogurts and cheeses; bones and shanks enrich stocks.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Moderate marbling and connective tissue suit mixed methods: sear tender cuts, slow-cook sinewy ones. Rest cooked meats; render fat for flavor control.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Protein with moderate fat; flavor compounds reflect pasture and age. Minerals include B vitamins and iron in redder muscles.

_Safety & handling._ Handle as red meat with standard hygiene; cook ground forms through. Manage surface fat and strong aromas via trimming and herbs.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Breed and forage shape taste; younger lamb is milder than older mutton. Store cold; freeze portions; age improves tenderness in select cuts.
