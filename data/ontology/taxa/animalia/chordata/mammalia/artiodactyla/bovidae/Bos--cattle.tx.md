_Culinary scope & forms._ Prime steaks, roasts, ground beef, and charcuterie sit alongside stocks from bones and collagen-rich cuts for braises. Dairy derivatives (butter, cheeses) belong to related managed species.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Marbling and connective tissue dictate method: grill tender primals; braise shanks and chuck. Dry-aging concentrates flavor and tenderness; resting is key after high heat.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Protein with variable fat; micronutrients include B12, iron, and zinc. Collagen-heavy cuts yield gelatin; fat profile shifts with feed.

_Safety & handling._ Observe cross-contamination controls, proper doneness for ground, and storage temperatures. Processed meats can be sodium-dense; balance seasoning.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Breed, feed (grass/grain), and aging change flavor and fatness. Store cold; freeze for longevity; trim or render as needed.
