_Culinary scope & forms._ Steaks sear or grill quickly; roasts braise; ground forms make burgers and chilis; dried meats appear regionally. Bones create rich stocks and sauces.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Leaner than many beef cuts; avoid overcooking to prevent dryness. Moist cooking or added fat helps in ground applications; resting improves juiciness.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Typically protein-dense with lower marbling; mineral patterns resemble beef. Flavor is robust yet clean, reflecting forage.

_Safety & handling._ Cook ground meat through; steaks can be cooked to preference with care. Handle as red meat with normal hygiene and cold-chain diligence.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Range, feed, and age shape flavor and tenderness. Store cold; use promptly; freeze well with minor texture impact.
