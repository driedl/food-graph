_Culinary scope & forms._ Loins and chops sear or roast; shoulders excel low-and-slow; bellies cure into bacon; hams brine and smoke; sausages span fresh to dry-cured.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Fat content and connective tissue dictate method; low-and-slow converts collagen to gelatin. Crisping skin elevates roasts; resting preserves juices.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Protein with variable fat; thiamin is usually strong; flavor depends on breed and feed. Sodium rises in cured products.

_Safety & handling._ Cook ground and some whole cuts through per local guidance; avoid cross-contamination. Cures and smokes require handling to control salt and nitrite levels.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Breed and diet shape flavor and fat; heritage lines differ from commodity pork. Store cold; freeze portions; aging and curing alter texture and taste.
