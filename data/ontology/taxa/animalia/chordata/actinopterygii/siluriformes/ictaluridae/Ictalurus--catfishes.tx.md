_Culinary scope & forms._ Skinless fillets bread and fry crisply, blacken under high heat, or stew gently. Whole smaller fish grill or braise; bones and heads make stock.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Fine-grained flesh cooks fast and dries if overdone; moderate heat to just opaque preserves juiciness. Acidic marinades and spice rubs complement mild flavor.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Protein-forward with low to moderate fat; omega-3s present but lower than oily fish; mineral patterns include B12 and selenium.

_Safety & handling._ Maintain cold chain; fillets are delicate. Fried formats add substantial oil and sodium; manage seasoning. Wild fish can carry muddy notes without proper purging.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Feed and water quality shape taste and texture; farmed supply dominates. Store very cold; cook soon after thaw; freeze acceptably with minor texture change.
