_Culinary scope & forms._ Commonly canned in water or oil, smoked/dried into katsuobushi for dashi, or seared briefly for tataki. Steaks and loins accept bold seasoning and high heat.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Firm, meaty flesh withstands grilling and searing; brief cooking preserves juiciness. Dried/smoked forms concentrate umami and keep long.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Meaty with noticeable natural oils; flavor is assertive. Canned media (water vs oil) changes richness and calories.

_Safety & handling._ As a scombrid, strict cold chain helps prevent histamine formation. Canned products are shelf-stable until opened; then refrigerate promptly.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Catch method and handling affect quality; smaller size trends to lower mercury than giant tunas. Store raw loins very cold; use quickly; keep flakes dry and sealed.
