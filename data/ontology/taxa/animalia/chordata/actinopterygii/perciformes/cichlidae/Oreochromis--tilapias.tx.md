_Culinary scope & forms._ Skinless fillets take spice rubs, breadcrumb crusts, and citrus sauces well. Whole smaller fish steam or grill. Breaded forms and fish tacos are common.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Fine-grained flesh cooks quickly and dries if overdone; moderate heat to just opaque preserves moisture. Marinades and light brines improve seasoning.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Protein-forward with low to moderate fat; micronutrient patterns include B12 and selenium; flavor is mild. Fatty-acid profile reflects feed.

_Safety & handling._ Maintain good refrigeration; fillets are delicate. Cross-contamination controls as for any raw fish. Breaded products may carry significant sodium.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Farming practices (stocking density, feed) shape flavor and texture. Store very cold; cook soon after thaw; frozen blocks portion well.
