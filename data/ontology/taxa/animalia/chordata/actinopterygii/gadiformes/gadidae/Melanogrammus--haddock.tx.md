_Culinary scope & forms._ Fresh fillets bake, poach, or fry; smoked haddock underpins kedgeree and chowders; trimmings enrich soups. Light batters suit its tenderness.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Finer flake than cod; take care not to overcook. Smoking firms texture and deepens flavor; poaching preserves moisture.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Similar to cod: lean protein, modest fat, with marine minerals. Smoke processing adds sodium; flavor skews slightly sweeter than cod.

_Safety & handling._ Keep cold; use smoked products promptly once opened. Watch added salt from cures. Bone content is light but present.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Seasonal fatness and handling influence juiciness. Frozen quality can be excellent. Store near 0–2 °C; cook soon after thaw.
