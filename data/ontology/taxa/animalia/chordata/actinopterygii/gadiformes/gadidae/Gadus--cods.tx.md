_Culinary scope & forms._ Fillets and loins suit gentle baking, poaching, and pan-frying; salted cod rehydrates for stews, fritters, and brandade. Trimmings and frames make light stocks; cheeks and tongues are regional treats.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Large flakes separate when just set; overcooking dries quickly. Batter or breadcrumbs protect moisture in frying; milk poaching tenderizes. Salt-cured forms need desalting to taste.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Lean, high-protein fish with modest natural fat; iodine and selenium are consistent. Liver oils concentrate fat-soluble nutrients; muscle flavor is mild.

_Safety & handling._ Maintain cold chain to avoid spoilage odors. Salt cod is shelf-stable until soaked; observe hygiene during rehydration. Bones are few but present in some cuts.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Species, catch ground, and handling affect moisture and firmness. Frozen-at-sea can match fresh quality. Store very cold; cook soon after thaw; keep salt cod cool and dry.
