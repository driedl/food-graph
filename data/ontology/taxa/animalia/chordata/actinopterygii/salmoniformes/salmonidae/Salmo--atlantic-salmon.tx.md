_Culinary scope & forms._ Center-cut fillets, sides, and portions take grills, roasts, and pan sears; bellies and trimmings cure and smoke well; canned forms extend convenience.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Richer cuts handle high heat; lean ends benefit from gentler cooking. Keep interior succulentâ€”overcooking leads to albumin weeping; resting helps redistribute juices.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Typically meaty with natural oils; skins provide fat and collagen. Bone-in canned variants contribute calcium; vitamin D commonly appears.

_Safety & handling._ Follow freezing guidance for raw uses; maintain cold chain. Smoked styles are sodium-forward. Pin bones are common; remove for service.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Farm systems and feed influence fatness and flavor; wild runs vary seasonally. Store very cold; consume promptly; freeze with small texture tradeoffs.
