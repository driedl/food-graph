_Culinary scope & forms._ Fillets and sides grill or roast; bellies suit cures and smoke; canned bone-in portions enrich salads and patties. Raw uses require validated freezing; roe appears as vibrant garnish.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Higher natural oils tolerate grilling and smoking; leaner species dry faster and prefer gentle heat. Doneness is flexible, from translucent to fully set; rest carries heat.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Characteristically meaty with natural oils; skin carries fat and collagen. Bone-in canned forms contribute calcium; vitamin D is often present.

_Safety & handling._ Freeze for parasite control when serving raw; maintain cold chain. Smoked products can be high in sodium. Bones in canned forms are soft yet present.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Species, run, and feed shape fat and flavor; wild vs farmed differences are notable. Store very cold; use promptly; freeze well with minor texture change.
