Suids support fresh cookery (chops, loin, shoulder), low-and-slow methods for collagen (ribs, hocks), and charcuterie (ham, bacon, sausages). They provide complete protein, good B-vitamin coverage (notably thiamin), zinc, and selenium; fatty-acid profiles skew more MUFA than many ruminants, with substantial variability by cut and feeding. Curing and smoking add preservation and flavor but raise sodium and can introduce nitrites/nitrates; lean, minimally processed cuts keep calories and salt lower. Offal (liver, blood) is nutrient-dense; rinds/skin contribute gelatin after long cooking. Handle pork with strict hygiene and proper internal temperatures to manage pathogens. Regional butchery traditions (e.g., Iberian, East Asian) define distinct flavor/fat qualities that child nodes can capture.
