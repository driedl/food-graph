summary: Complete proteins with bioavailable minerals and cholesterol; fat profiles vary by lineage/diet, with marine species rich in EPA/DHA.

Animals sit higher in the food web and typically offer complete proteins with all essential amino acids and readily absorbed minerals. Lipids vary by lineage and diet: ruminants skew more saturated, monogastrics mirror feed fats, and marine species concentrate long-chain omega-3s (EPA/DHA). Cholesterol is intrinsic to animal cells; heme iron appears in vertebrate muscle; dairy concentrates calcium; eggs concentrate choline and fat-soluble vitamins. Processing/parts (muscle vs. organ vs. milk/egg) become strong nutritional differentiators further down.
