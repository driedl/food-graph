Scombrids are adaptable—seared steaks, grills, confit, canning—with robust taste and satisfying texture. They deliver complete protein, very high EPA/DHA, and often meaningful vitamin D. Larger, long-lived species can accumulate mercury; species/size metadata informs serving frequency. Histamine risk rises with temperature abuse, so strict cold-chain matters. Canned tuna varies in pack medium and sodium; water-packed keeps calories lower, oil-packed improves mouthfeel and fat profile. Small coastal mackerels offer intense flavor with typically lower mercury than giant tunas.
