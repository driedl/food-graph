This class covers edible crustaceans (shrimp, crab, lobster, crayfish, krill). Flesh is typically high in protein and low in fat and calories; lipid content rises with roe and tomalley. Notable micronutrients include iodine, selenium, copper, zinc, vitamin B12, and choline; pigments such as astaxanthin concentrate in shells/roe. Dietary cholesterol is comparatively high per 100 g. Common concerns: shellfish allergy, purine load for gout-prone individuals, and variable sodium when brined or processed. Shells provide chitin (insoluble fiber) when used for stocks or powders.
