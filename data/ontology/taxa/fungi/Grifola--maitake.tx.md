_Culinary scope & forms._ Tear into petals and roast or sear for crispy edges; tempura highlights texture; stems and trimmings enrich stocks and sauces.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Dense structure browns beautifully; avoid overcrowding. Brief marinades of soy and mirin boost glaze and umami.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Low energy with fiber and savory nucleotides; characteristic earthy volatiles develop with heat.

_Safety & handling._ Cook thoroughly for best flavor and digestibility; occasional sensitivity exists like with other mushrooms. Clean with minimal moisture.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Size and age alter chew and moisture; store chilled, ventilated, and dry; use before edges toughen.
