_Culinary scope & forms._ Separate clusters, trim base, and sauté or roast for nutty notes; add late to soups for texture. Works with miso, butter, and herbs.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Stems keep pleasant chew; avoid overcooking caps. High heat develops aroma; modest oil prevents sticking.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Typical mushroom profile: low calories, some fiber, savory compounds. Slight nuttiness complements rich sauces.

_Safety & handling._ Cook through for best flavor. Rinse briefly if needed and dry well; store cold and ventilated.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ White and brown cultivars differ slightly in aroma. Use within a few days to avoid sliminess.
