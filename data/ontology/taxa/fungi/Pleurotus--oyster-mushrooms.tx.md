_Culinary scope & forms._ Tear into strips and roast for crispy edges; sauté for quick sides; fry as cutlets; use stems and trimmings for stocks. King oysters slice into "scallops."

_Texture & cooking logic._ High heat drives browning; avoid overcrowding. Pressing expels moisture and improves sear; overcooking can toughen stems.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Low energy with fiber and savory notes; mild flavor welcomes sauces and spice. Some species develop slight seafood nuances when browned.

_Safety & handling._ Cook before eating; brush clean. Rare sensitivities exist as with other mushrooms.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Species and size drive chew and aroma; store chilled and ventilated; use within a few days for best texture.
