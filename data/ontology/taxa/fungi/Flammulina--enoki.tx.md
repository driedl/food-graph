_Culinary scope & forms._ Snip bases and add clusters to broths, ramen, and hotpots; quick stir-fries and pickles keep crunch. Mild flavor pairs with chili oil and soy.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Very fast cooking preserves snap; prolonged heat softens excessively. Separate strands for even heating.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Light, hydrating mushrooms with modest protein and fiber; subtle umami supports broths.

_Safety & handling._ Prefer cooking rather than raw use; wash lightly and check for cleanliness between stems. Refrigerate promptly and use soon after opening.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar and grow conditions affect stem length and crunch. Keep chilled in breathable packs; avoid sliminess or strong odors.
