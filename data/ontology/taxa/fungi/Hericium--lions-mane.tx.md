_Culinary scope & forms._ Slice thick and sear until browned; roast to drive out moisture; shred and bind for cakes. Absorbs butter, cream, and aromatic oils well.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Gentle pressing while searing expels water and builds crust; avoid steaming, which blunts browning. Overcooking can dry and fibrously toughen.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Modest protein and fiber with delicate flavor; takes on sauces readily. Volatile profile is subtle until browned.

_Safety & handling._ Cook before eating; rare sensitivities occur. Brush clean; avoid soaking. Trim any tough base material.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar and size influence texture; store chilled and ventilated; use within a few days for best aroma.
