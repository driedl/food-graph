_Culinary scope & forms._ Fresh caps sauté, roast, or grill; dried shiitake rehydrate for broths and braises; stems flavor stocks. Remove tough stems before service.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Browning amplifies aroma; dried forms are denser and more intense. Avoid overcrowding to prevent steaming.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Low-energy with fiber and notable umami nucleotides; rehydration liquor is especially savory.

_Safety & handling._ Cook thoroughly; rare "shiitake dermatitis" can occur in sensitive individuals, more often with undercooked fresh. Clean with minimal water.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Log-grown vs substrate changes aroma; dried quality varies by grade. Store fresh chilled and ventilated; keep dried airtight.
