_Culinary scope & forms._ Buttons and cremini sauté quickly; portobellos grill and stuff well; stems and trimmings enrich stocks. Caps absorb fats and aromatics, amplifying browning flavors.

_Texture & cooking logic._ High water cooks off, concentrating umami; avoid crowding to brown. Larger caps develop chewy, meatlike bite; overcooking can dry and toughen.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Low-calorie with modest protein and fibers; umami nucleotides and glutamates drive savoriness. UV-exposed products may carry vitamin D2.

_Safety & handling._ Clean gently; avoid soaking. Consume cooked or well-heated for best digestibility and flavor; raw can be bland and spongy.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Size and maturity change flavor and texture; store chilled in breathable packaging; use promptly to avoid sliming.
