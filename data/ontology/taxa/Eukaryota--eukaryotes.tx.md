summary: Nucleus-bearing life that includes animals, plants, fungi, and algae; this root node spans all edible organisms and ingredients—from meats, fish, and dairy to grains, vegetables, fruits, mushrooms, seaweeds, and ferments.

_Culinary scope & forms._ This node is the umbrella for nearly everything cooks handle: animal foods (meat, fish, eggs, dairy), plants (leafy greens, stems, roots, grains, pulses, oils, herbs, spices), fungi (culinary mushrooms; yeasts for bread, beer, and wine), and algae/seaweeds. Edible outputs arrive raw or transformed—milled, pressed, cured, smoked, fermented, dried, canned—each process trading perishability for flavor, texture, or convenience.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Animal muscles vary from tender to collagen-rich and suggest quick sears versus slow braises; fish range from delicate white to firm, oily species suited to grills and smoke. Plant tissues pivot on water, pectin, and cellulose—brief heat keeps snap, longer cooking softens and sweetens; starches gel and retrograde with time. Eggs set emulsions and foams; dairy fats carry aroma; fermentation reorganizes flavor, acidity, and texture across categories.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Eukaryote foods span the spectrum: complete proteins common in animal foods and some fish; complementary plant proteins in grains + legumes; fats ranging from dairy and animal lipids to plant and nut oils; carbohydrates from simple sugars to resistant starches and diverse fibers. Micronutrient "centers" shift—leafy plants for folate and vitamin C, animal foods for B12 and heme iron, oily fish for long-chain omega-3s, certain mushrooms when UV-exposed for vitamin D, and bone-in fish or dairy styles for calcium. Actual values hinge on species, cut, cultivar, feed, season, and processing.

_Safety & handling._ Core risks cluster into allergens (milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat/gluten, soy), natural compounds (e.g., cyanogenic, oxalates, glycoalkaloids), and microbes/parasites managed by cold-chain, clean prep, and appropriate doneness. Raw fish uses often require validated freezing; canning, pickling, and fermenting must follow proven methods; cross-contamination controls matter across raw meats and ready-to-eat foods.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Provenance, breed/cultivar, season, and husbandry/habitat drive flavor, texture, and fat/sugar profiles; processing (fresh vs frozen, aged vs cured) changes performance more than many recipes do. Store meats/seafood and most dairy cold; keep produce humid but not wet; hold grains, nuts, and spices dry and airtight; freeze to extend life with some texture trade-offs. Downstream nodes refine these patterns into cooking methods and serving guidance for each lineage.
