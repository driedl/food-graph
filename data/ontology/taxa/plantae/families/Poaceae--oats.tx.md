_Culinary scope & forms._ Simmer steel-cut for porridge; soak rolled oats overnight; toast into granola; grind into flour for cookies and breads; blend into oat milk and strain.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Toast before simmering for nutty depth; control thickness with water-to-oat ratios; rest porridges to thicken naturally.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Mild, creamy grain flavor; soluble components give body to porridges and beverages.

_Safety & handling._ Gluten-free handling requires dedicated facilitiesâ€”check labels if needed. Store dry; cooked oats chill and reheat well.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cut vs rolled vs instant change cook time and texture. Keep oats airtight and cool to preserve freshness.
