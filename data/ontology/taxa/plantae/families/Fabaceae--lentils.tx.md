_Culinary scope & forms._ Red/yellow split lentils cook into smooth dals and soups; green/brown hold shape for salads and pilafs; tiny Puy styles keep a pleasant bite. Fry cooked lentils into patties or temper with spices and aromatics.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Avoid over-stirring if you want intact grains; simmer gently. Skim foam; salt late to keep hulls more intact.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Earthy, mild base that welcomes spice and acid; red types taste slightly sweeter and creamier when cooked down.

_Safety & handling._ Rinse before cooking; check for stones. Store cooked portions chilled; they thicken as they sit—loosen with stock.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Age affects cook time; buy from high-turnover sources. Keep dry and cool; split types cook fastest.
