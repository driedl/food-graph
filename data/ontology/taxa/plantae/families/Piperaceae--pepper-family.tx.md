Peppercorns deliver piperine-driven pungency with terpene top notes; green/black/white forms reflect harvest stage and processing. They add trace minerals but are used chiefly for aroma and heat; piperine can enhance bioavailability of certain compounds in mixed dishes. Betel and other leaves serve as wraps or herbs in regional cuisines; usage is culinary, not caloric. Whole peppercorns keep fragrance longer than pre-ground; coarse grinds preserve aroma in cooked dishes. High-heat toasting briefly wakes volatile oils. Excessive use can irritate mucosaâ€”culinary moderation is standard.
