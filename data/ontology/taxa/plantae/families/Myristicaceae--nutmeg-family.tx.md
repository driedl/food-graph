Nutmeg/mace deliver concentrated essential oils (e.g., myristicin, eugenol derivatives) that perfume custards, sauces, and cured meats. Nutritional contribution is minor at typical doses, though manganese is notable per gram. Whole seeds retain volatile compounds better than pre-ground spice; fresh grating maximizes impact. Excessive intake is unsafe due to psychoactive/toxic componentsâ€”culinary pinches are the norm. Oil extractions and oleoresins power industrial flavoring. Storage in cool, dark conditions preserves aroma.
