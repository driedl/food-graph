_Culinary scope & forms._ Use fresh grated in pastes and pickles; dry and grind for powders in spice blends and curries; bloom in fat to unlock aroma; steep in milky drinks and broths.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Fresh rhizome is fibrous—fine grate or pound; dried powder disperses easily. Bloom gently in oil to release aroma; avoid scorching which turns bitter.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Earthy, slightly bitter warmth; modest amounts color entire dishes. Partners well with ginger, cumin, chile, and black pepper.

_Safety & handling._ Stains hands, boards, and fabrics—line cutting surfaces. Store powders airtight and dark; fresh rhizomes mold if kept too wet.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Alleppey vs Madras and other origins differ in color and aroma. Refrigerate fresh; freeze grated portions; rotate powders often.
