Buckwheat provides gluten-free starch with good amino-acid balance and the flavonoid rutin; roasting (kasha) deepens nutty notes. Rhubarb stalks add acidity and fiber; leaves are not eaten due to high oxalate. Soaking and rinsing groats alter texture for salads vs porridge. Milling fineness affects baking behavior and bitterness. Pair rhubarb with sugar and fat for balance; calcium co-ingestion helps moderate oxalate concerns. Origin and hull removal determine cooking time and aroma.
