Kiwifruit combine tangy sweetness with edible seeds; green types contain actinidin, a protease that can tenderize meats and influence dairy textures. They're nutrient-dense per calorie with vitamin C, vitamin K, and fiber; seeds contribute trace ALA omega-3s. Texture and acidity vary by cultivar and ripeness; chilled storage extends shelf life but dampens aroma. Some people are kiwi-allergic; peeling can reduce oral irritation. Enzyme activity softens gelatin and certain dairyâ€”use after setting or in cooked applications if firmness is required. Golden varieties are generally sweeter and less acidic.
