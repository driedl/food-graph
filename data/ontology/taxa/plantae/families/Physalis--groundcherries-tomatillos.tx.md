_Culinary scope & forms._ Remove papery husks; rinse sticky residue. Roast tomatillos for salsa verde; simmer into sauces; eat groundcherries fresh, in jams, or dipped in chocolate; dehydrate for chewy snacks.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Tomatillos soften to saucy consistency with heat; roasting adds charred depth. Groundcherries hold shape better; add late to preserves for chunks.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Tomatillos skew tart and vegetal; groundcherries read tropical and honeyed with mild acidity. Both deliver bright flavors that cut richness.

_Safety & handling._ Eat ripe fruits; discard green, unripe, or damaged fruits and all foliage. Wash thoroughly after dehusking.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Species vary in sweetness and tartness. Store tomatillos cool and husked or un-husked; keep groundcherries dry and ventilated.
