Asparagus offers low-calorie spears with folate, vitamin K, and inulin-type prebiotic fibers. White types are blanched from sunlight to limit chlorophyll; purple cultivars are sweeter but turn green with cooking. Quick blanching or roasting preserves snap; prolonged boiling leaches flavor. Sulfurous volatiles appear during cooking and in urineâ€”normal chemistry. Spear thickness, freshness, and cut point determine tenderness and cook time. Pairing with butter or olive oil improves flavor carry and fat-soluble vitamin absorption.
