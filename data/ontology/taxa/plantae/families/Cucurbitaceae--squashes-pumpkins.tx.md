_Culinary scope & forms._ Zucchini and summer squash sauté, grill, and shave raw; winter squash roast, mash, soup, and fill pastas; seeds roast for snacks and sauces; seed oils dress and finish.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Summer types cook fast and water out—salt/drain to control moisture. Winter types caramelize well; steam/roast to softness before puréeing. Peel or roast skin-on depending on variety.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Mild to nutty sweetness; orange-fleshed types are richer and denser. Seeds add toasty notes and body to sauces when ground.

_Safety & handling._ Rare extreme bitterness signals cucurbitacins—discard. Take care cutting large, dense fruits; stabilize on board and use sharp knives.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Varieties vary in dryness and sweetness. Store winter squash cool and dry; use summer squash within days for snap.
