_Culinary scope & forms._ Scoop fresh flesh for chilled desserts, puddings, quick breads, and ice creams. Purées sub for banana in smoothies and batters; strains remove seeds and fibers.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Very soft, custard-like flesh browns on air exposure; acidulation helps. Gentle heat works for custards; avoid prolonged cooking that mutes perfume.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Presents lush sweetness and tropical aromas; dense texture lends body to dairy and custards without additional thickeners.

_Safety & handling._ Seeds and skin are not eaten. Some individuals report sensitivity to compounds in skin and seeds; remove thoroughly. Use strict hygiene due to short shelf life.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivars differ in seediness, flavor strength, and bitterness. Fruit ripens rapidly and bruises easily; refrigerate promptly and use within days or freeze purée.
