Guava provides juicy flesh with seeds, while clove and allspice contribute high-impact aromatics rich in polyphenols and eugenol-type compounds. Fruits offer vitamin C, fiber, and carotenoids; spices add negligible calories but potent antioxidant capacity. Spice intensity is shaped by origin, harvest stage, and drying; whole spices store better than ground. Essential oil distillations are used sparingly due to potency. Some individuals may experience oral irritation from concentrated eugenol; culinary dilutions mitigate this. Child nodes can encode cultivar-specific flavors (e.g., pink vs white guavas).
