_Culinary scope & forms._ Toast lightly for salads and cheeses; candy for snacks; grind into pastes for pastries and sauces; press oils for dressings. Green walnuts cure into nocino and preserves.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Roast just to aromaticâ€”overheating turns bitter. Peel thin skins for refined textures; grind with care to avoid oily pastes where unwanted.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Distinctive walnut aroma with mild bitterness from skins; oils are intensely perfumed and best uncooked.

_Safety & handling._ Tree-nut allergies apply. Keep away from heat and air to prevent rancidity; inspect for shell fragments.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Chandler vs Persian vs black walnuts vary in flavor intensity and bitterness. Store kernels and oils cold and sealed.
