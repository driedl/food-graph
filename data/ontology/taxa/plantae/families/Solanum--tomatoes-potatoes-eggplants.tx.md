_Culinary scope & forms._ Tomatoes: raw salads, sauces, pastes, canned, and sun-dried. Potatoes: boil, mash, roast, fry; starch types suit different methods. Eggplants: roast, grill, fry, braise; salt or score to manage moisture.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Tomatoes concentrate with slow cooking; oil boosts flavor carry. Waxy potatoes hold shape; floury types mash and fry well. Eggplants reward high heat to collapse and brown.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Tomatoes bring bright acidity and umami; potatoes deliver neutral, comforting starch; eggplants add mild bitterness and spongy richness when browned.

_Safety & handling._ Greened or sprouted potatoes concentrate glycoalkaloids—discard. Tomato acidity influences canning safety when applicable. Eggplants can absorb much oil—control with high heat.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar and maturity dictate performance. Store potatoes cool, dark, and dry; tomatoes at room temp until ripe; eggplants cool but not cold.
