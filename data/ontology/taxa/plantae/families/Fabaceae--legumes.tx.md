Legumes furnish affordable staples: dried beans and lentils for soups/stews, fresh shelling peas, green pods (e.g., snap beans), and fermented/curdled soy products. They supply plant protein, soluble/insoluble fibers, folate, potassium, iron (non-heme), and magnesium; soy is notably protein-dense. Soaking, sprouting, pressure-cooking, and fermentation reduce phytates/lectins and improve digestibility and mineral absorption. Canned legumes are convenient but often saltyâ€”rinsing helps. Peanut and soy allergies are significant for some consumers. Flavor and cooking time vary widely by species and age; metadata on variety and harvest can improve recipe guidance.
