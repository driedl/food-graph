Flaxseed is rich in ALA omega-3s, lignans, and both soluble and insoluble fibers. Grinding increases fatty-acid availabilityâ€”whole seeds often pass intact. Hydration (soaking) or heat reduces small amounts of cyanogenic precursors. Oils are delicate and best for cold use; avoid high-heat frying. Meal adds viscosity and moisture retention to gluten-free baking. Storage in cool, dark conditions limits rancidity; nitrogen-flushed packaging helps.
