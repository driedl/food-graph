Grapes vary widely by cultivar in sugar, acidity, and tanninâ€”table vs wine types diverge. Fresh grapes provide hydration, vitamin K, and polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol in skins); raisins concentrate sugars and calories while losing most water. Fermentation creates alcohol and complex aromas; vinegar production converts alcohol to acetic acid. Leaves contribute lignified structure softened by brining. Seeds yield oils with delicate flavor; clarification determines culinary uses. Sulfite labeling appears on many processed grape products.
