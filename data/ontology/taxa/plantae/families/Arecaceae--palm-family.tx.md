Coconut products are rich in saturated fats (including MCTs) and calories; forms range from fresh flesh to canned milk and extracted oils. Dates are dense in natural sugars with fiber and potassium; drying and paste forms enable confections. Hearts of palm offer tender, low-calorie vegetable texture. Palm sap can be fermented or reduced; palm oils vary by species in carotenoids and flavor. Portion size drives energy intake; coconut and date derivatives are especially calorie-concentrated. Sustainability and processing (e.g., bleaching/refining) influence nutrition and flavor.
