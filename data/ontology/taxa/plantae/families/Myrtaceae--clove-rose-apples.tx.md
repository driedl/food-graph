_Culinary scope & forms._ Clove buds used whole or ground in bakes, masalas, pickles, and stews; rose-apple fruits eaten fresh or in jams and salads in tropical regions.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Whole cloves infuse slowly; grind sparingly to avoid dominance. Fruits are crisp-watery—treat like mild pears with floral perfume.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Clove is intensely aromatic and numbing-spicy; fruits are light and refreshing with subtle florals.

_Safety & handling._ Clove oil is potent—avoid direct undiluted use in food. Remove whole cloves before serving to prevent hard bites.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Species vary widely; buy cloves from high-oil sources. Store spices airtight; chill fruits and eat promptly.
