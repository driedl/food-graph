_Culinary scope & forms._ This node covers fresh table fruit, baking varieties, dried fruits, juices and ciders, jams and jellies, vinegars, and spirits, plus almond kernels from drupe stones. Preparations span raw snacking, pies and tarts, poaching, roasting, grilling, and fermentations from cider to fruit wines.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Pomes keep structure with pectin-rich cell walls; acidity and cultivar drive set in jams and gels. Stone fruits soften rapidly with heat; high-heat roasting concentrates sugars and caramel notes. Berries collapse quickly and excel in sauces, coulis, and quick preserves.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Typical patterns include water, natural sugars, organic acids, and pectin; pigments such as anthocyanins and carotenoids drive color. Almonds are energy-dense seeds with fats and vitamin E, distinct from fleshy fruits within the family.

_Safety & handling._ Stone fruit pits and certain kernels contain amygdalin; edible almonds are processed cultivars. Browning in cut apples/pears benefits from acidulation. Soft berries are perishable and mold-prone; careful washing close to use preserves quality.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar, ripeness, and handling determine sweetness, aroma, and texture. Controlled-atmosphere storage extends apples and pears; stone fruits prefer brief room-ripening then chilling. Drying and preserves trade perishability for intensity and sugar.
