_Culinary scope & forms._ Use bread flours for yeasted loaves and pizza; cake/pastry flours for tender bakes; durum for pasta and couscous; bulgur and freekeh for quick pilafs. Prefer sourdough or poolish for depth.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Gluten development via mixing and folding creates structure; rest (autolyse) improves extensibility. Durum forms elastic doughs for extruded pasta; ancient wheats make flavorful, slightly denser loaves.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Neutral grain base that highlights fermentation and milling; bran and germ raise aroma and chew in whole-wheat styles; refined flours bake lighter and milder.

_Safety & handling._ Contains gluten. Store whole-grain flours cold to prevent rancidity; refreshed starters maintain lively fermentation.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Protein content, ash, and grind control water absorption and crumb. Keep flour airtight; rotate stock; refrigerate whole-grain flour.
