_Culinary scope & forms._ Grind for smoothies and baking; sprinkle whole on breads and salads; press oils for cold uses; create crackers and seed mixes with water-gel.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Grind just before use for freshness; whole seeds add crunch but often pass intact. Avoid high heat with oils; use for dressings and drizzle.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Mildly nutty flavor; ground meal thickens batters and adds moisture retention in gluten-free baking.

_Safety & handling._ Small cyanogenic precursors are reduced by heat/hydration; normal culinary amounts are standard. Keep oils and meals cold to avoid rancidity.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Golden vs brown types are similar in kitchen use. Store seeds cool and dry; refrigerate ground meal and oils.
