_Culinary scope & forms._ Bake dense or light rye breads, crispbreads, and crackers; cook berries for salads; mash or malt for spirits and beer; use flour in pancakes and cookies. Prefer sourdough or preferments for nuanced flavor.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Lower gluten quality than wheat—blend or use preferments to improve rise. Pentosans absorb water; doughs feel sticky—wet-hand handling helps. Long, cool fermentation brings spice and complexity.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Earthy-spicy aroma with subtle sweetness; whole and dark flours taste bolder than light rye. Rye crumbs stay moist and sliceable due to water-binding components.

_Safety & handling._ Contains gluten—unsuitable for strict gluten-free diets. Store whole grain and dark flours cool to prevent rancidity.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Stoneground vs roller-milled changes flavor and absorption. Keep flour airtight and chilled; cook berries until pleasantly chewy.
