_Culinary scope & forms._ Edible parts span leaves (cabbage, kale), buds (broccoli, Brussels sprouts), roots (turnips), seeds (mustard, rapeseed), and stems (kohlrabi). Preparations include salads and slaws, sautés and roasts, kimchi/sauerkraut, curries, and seed condiments and oils.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Chop or shred for quick heat penetration; brief high heat preserves snap and sulfur top notes, longer cooking sweetens and softens. Fermentation develops tang and aroma; blanch before freezing to retain color.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Expect sharp-mustardy aromatics from glucosinolates; gentle cooking retains character while taming bitterness. Seed oils vary from pungent mustard to neutral canola suitable for frying and dressings.

_Safety & handling._ Overcooking can sulfur-smell; vent kitchens and avoid overcrowding pans. Handling chili–mustard mixes cautiously prevents eye/skin irritation. Rinse heads/leaves well—soil hides in folds.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar, season, and frost influence sweetness and bitterness. Store leaves cold and humid; keep whole heads wrapped; use sprouts/buds promptly for best texture.
