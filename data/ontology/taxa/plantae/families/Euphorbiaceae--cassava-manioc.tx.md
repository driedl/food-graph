_Culinary scope & forms._ Cassava boils, fries, or mashes; flours and granules make flatbreads, cakes, and tapioca pearls; fermented variants add tang and function. Leaves simmer into stews after extended cooking.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Cook thoroughly to soften dense cells; cooling can create chewy textures and resistant starch. Frying yields crisp shells with tender interiors.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Neutral flavor supports sauces and stews; fermented flours bring subtle sour complexity. Leaves contribute vegetal notes when cooked down.

_Safety & handling._ Proper soaking/fermentation and thorough cooking reduce cyanogenic compounds, especially in bitter cultivars. Avoid undercooking; treat peels and soaking water as discard.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivars vary in dryness and sweetness; flours range from sweet to sour. Store roots cool and use promptly; keep flours dry and sealed.
