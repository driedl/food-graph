_Culinary scope & forms._ Sprinkle seeds on breads and salads, toast for nutty aroma, grind into tahini for sauces and sweets, and use oils for dressings and finishing.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Toast gently for deeper flavor; black vs white seeds differ in bitterness and visual pop. Tahini thickens with water—emulsify with acid.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Distinctive sesame perfume with rich, creamy tahini mouthfeel; oils add finishing fragrance.

_Safety & handling._ Sesame allergy is recognized; manage cross-contact. Oils can go rancid—store cool and dark.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Unhulled seeds retain more bitterness and calcium; origin shapes flavor. Keep seeds sealed; refrigerate tahini and oils after opening.
