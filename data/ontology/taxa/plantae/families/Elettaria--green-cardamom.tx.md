_Culinary scope & forms._ Lightly crush pods to release seeds; infuse in milks, syrups, and rice; grind seeds fresh for batters and spice mixes; remove husks before serving.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Whole pods infuse gently without grittiness; ground seed is potent but fades fastâ€”grind to order. Toast lightly to bloom before grinding.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ High-impact perfume at tiny doses; pairs with citrus, coffee, chocolate, and rich meats, lifting heaviness with aromatic brightness.

_Safety & handling._ Avoid biting into whole husks at service; strain or pick out. Keep ground cardamom airtight and use quickly.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Malabar vs Mysore profiles differ subtly; freshness is key. Store pods airtight and dark; grind seeds as needed.
