_Culinary scope & forms._ Cures include brine, lye, and natural fermentation; oils range from extra-virgin to refined. Use olives in salads, braises, pizzas; employ oils for dressing, sautéing, and finishing.

_Texture & cooking logic._ EVOO loses top notes with high heat—reserve some for finishing. Rinse very salty olives to adjust seasoning; pit for ease of eating.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Fruity, peppery to buttery aromas depending on cultivar and processing; table olives contribute briny, savory depth.

_Safety & handling._ Cured olives carry sodium; account for salt. Keep oils away from light and heat to prevent staling.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Variety, harvest timing, and milling drive flavor. Store oils cool and dark; refrigerate open olives submerged in brine.
