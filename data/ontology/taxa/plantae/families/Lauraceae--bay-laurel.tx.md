_Culinary scope & forms._ Add whole leaves to soups, stews, and braises; crush lightly to increase extraction; remove before serving. Fresh leaves are stronger—use fewer.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Prolonged simmer extracts resinous depth; brief use may taste raw and sharp. Toasting leaves a moment can wake aromatics before adding liquid.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Provides backbone herbal notes rather than bulk; synergizes with pepper, allium, and tomato bases.

_Safety & handling._ Leaves are not eaten; remove to avoid sharp edges. Avoid confusion with ornamental lookalikes.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Mediterranean vs California bay differ—California is more potent. Dry in the shade; store airtight.
