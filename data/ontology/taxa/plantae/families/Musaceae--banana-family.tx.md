Bananas and plantains differ mainly in starch/sugar ratio and culinary role—dessert fruit vs cooking staple. Bananas bring potassium, B6, and pectin; plantains excel in savory dishes after frying, boiling, or roasting. Ripening converts resistant starch to sugars, softening texture; chilling below ~12 °C can cause peel injury. Blossoms provide vegetal crunch and mild bitterness after prep; leaves are non-edible but aromatic wrappers. Drying and chips concentrate sugars and calories. Variety, ripeness, and handling determine sweetness and mouthfeel.
