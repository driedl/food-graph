Pineapple provides juicy acidity and sweetness with vitamin C and manganese; bromelain proteases can tenderize meats and affect dairy gels. Core and eyes vary in toughness by cultivar; trimming shapes yield. Canning alters texture and adds syrup unless packed in juice; drying concentrates sugars and calories. Enzymes can cause oral irritationâ€”salting or brief cooking helps. Ripeness is critical for aroma; refrigeration slows further development. Waste streams (peels/cores) flavor ferments and vinegars.
