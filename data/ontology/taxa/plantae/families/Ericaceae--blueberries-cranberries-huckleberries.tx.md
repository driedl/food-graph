_Culinary scope & forms._ Fresh berries top breakfasts and desserts; baking concentrates flavor in muffins and pies; cranberries and lingonberries cook into tangy sauces; dried forms amplify chew and sweetness.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Gentle heat collapses skins and thickens juices; maceration draws out syrup for quick sauces. Frozen berries bake well; toss in flour to prevent sinking.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Bright tart-sweet balance with floral and forest notes; cranberries skew sharper and love sugar and savory fats.

_Safety & handling._ Rinse just before use; berries mold quickly if wet. Sort out soft or leaking fruit to protect the rest.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar and region alter size, skin, and perfume. Keep refrigerated and dry; freeze extras on trays for long storage.
