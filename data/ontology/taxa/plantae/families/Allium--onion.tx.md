_Culinary scope & forms._ Onions, garlic, leeks, scallions, shallots, and chives underpin sautés, stocks, and sauces. Techniques range from raw slices and quick pickles to slow caramelization, confit, roasts, and black garlic fermentation. Granulated and powdered forms season rubs and blends.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Cutting releases sulfur chemistry; resting minced garlic briefly before cooking intensifies aroma. Low-and-slow heat builds sweetness; high heat browns fast. Leeks prefer gentle cooking; scallions and chives finish dishes.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Expect pronounced aromatics that mellow with heat; prebiotic fibers contribute body in stews. Sulfur-derived compounds define sharpness and sweet-savory depth after transformation.

_Safety & handling._ Some diners are sensitive to strong allium preparations. Avoid burning garlic, which turns bitter. Store bulbs cool and dry; refrigerate cut alliums and fresh greens.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Sweet onions vs storage onions differ in water and pungency; hardneck vs softneck garlic changes clove structure. Season, variety, and curing affect bite, sweetness, and keeping quality.
