_Culinary scope & forms._ Cube or mash for salads and dips; slice for sushi; blitz into smoothies and dressings; bake into quick breads; oil fries and dresses. Pairs with citrus, chile, herbs, and seafood.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Serve ripe but not over-soft; high heat can turn sootyâ€”use brief sears or keep raw. Acid slows browning; minimize air exposure.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Rich, buttery mouthfeel with subtle grassy notes; carries aromatics well and tempers heat and acidity in dishes.

_Safety & handling._ Remove pits carefully; peel may irritate sensitive skin. Keep cut fruit chilled and covered to limit browning.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Hass vs Fuerte and others vary in oil and texture. Ripen at room temp; chill when ready; avoid refrigeration of hard fruit.
