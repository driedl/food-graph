_Culinary scope & forms._ Score and roast for snacks; boil and peel for purées and stuffings; candy as marrons glacés; grind into flour for cakes and gnocchi. Pairs with game, chocolate, and winter aromatics.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Steam/boil eases peeling; roasting deepens sweetness and dryness—add fat or syrup for silkier purées. Flour lends tenderness and nutty aroma to bakes.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ More starchy and less oily than most nuts, yielding a sweet, chestnut-honey profile. Flours and pastes deliver concentrated aroma.

_Safety & handling._ Mold risk rises with poor drying—buy fresh, heavy nuts. Remove inner pellicle for the best texture; some varieties cling more.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ European, Asian, and American types vary in size and peelability. Store cool; freeze peeled kernels and purées.
