_Culinary scope & forms._ Baby spinach serves salads and smoothies; mature leaves and stems sauté, braise, purée into soups, or bake into savory pies. Brief blanching sets color for fillings; creamed styles showcase dairy pairing.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Leaves collapse quickly; cook just to wilt for a silky texture. Squeezing blanched spinach prevents watery fillings. Add fat and aromatics early to carry flavors; overcooking dulls color and introduces bitterness.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Presents a clean, green flavor with slight sweetness; a mineral edge signals maturity. Oxalate content can give chalky mouthfeel in very dense preparations; dairy or blanching can soften perception.

_Safety & handling._ Grit hides in stems and crinkles—wash thoroughly. Raw salad mixes should be kept cold and used by date. Cooked spinach cools quickly; chill promptly if storing.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Flat-leaf vs savoy types differ in texture and grit retention. Store cold in breathable bags; use baby leaves within a few days; older leaves suit cooking.
