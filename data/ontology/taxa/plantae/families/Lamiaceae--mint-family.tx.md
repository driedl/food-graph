Lamiate herbs bring terpenes and phenolics that elevate dishes without adding macros. Drying concentrates certain volatiles while reducing vitamin C; fresh leaves deliver brighter notes. Brief sautéing or hot-oil blooming releases aroma; prolonged high heat can mute top notes. Herbs contain small amounts of minerals and antioxidants; usage is typically teaspoon-scale. Some individuals may be sensitive to concentrated essential oils. Cultivar and terroir drive potency—metadata helps dose recipes.
