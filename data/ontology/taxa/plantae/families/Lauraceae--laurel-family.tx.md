Avocado supplies creamy, MUFA-rich flesh with fiber and potassium; ripeness is critical for texture. Cinnamon (true and cassia types) offers warm sweetness with distinct coumarin levels; bay leaves add resinous depth to long simmers. Spices contribute negligible calories but meaningful aromatics and polyphenols. Avocado browns on air exposureâ€”acid and minimizing cut surface help. Oil extractions capture flavor for dressings; high heat dulls delicate notes. Allergic skin reactions can occur with mango relatives; handle peels accordingly.
