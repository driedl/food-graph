_Culinary scope & forms._ Sweet potatoes bake, roast, mash, fry, and purée; leaves and stems sauté or stir-fry quickly with garlic and chilies. Chips and noodles appear regionally; starch thickens sauces.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Roasting concentrates sweetness; steaming preserves moisture for smooth purées. Cooling then reheating shifts texture toward waxy; greens cook in minutes—avoid over-wilt.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Orange types present deep sweetness and perfume; purple types add earthy berry notes. Greens bring a mild, spinach-like profile that suits robust aromatics.

_Safety & handling._ Trim fibrous ends from greens; wash sand from hollow stems. Avoid chilling injury to roots—store cool but not cold.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar, curing, and age determine sweetness and moisture. Store roots in a dark, cool pantry; cook greens promptly after purchase.
