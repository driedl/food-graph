_Culinary scope & forms._ Roast and peel for salsas and salads; char for rajas; dry and grind into powders; blend into pastes like gochujang/harissa styles; sauté sweet bells; stuff larger peppers.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Capsaicin concentrates in placental tissue—strip for milder heat. Drying and smoking create complex flavors (ancho, chipotle); toasting whole chiles briefly awakens aroma before soaking.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Sweet bells deliver crisp juiciness; hot chiles add heat and fruitiness from mild to searing. Roasting amplifies sweetness; drying intensifies complexity.

_Safety & handling._ Wear gloves with hot chiles; avoid eye contact. Ventilate during high-heat roasting. Wash hands and tools carefully.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Species and cultivar determine heat and flavor; fresh vs dried differ dramatically. Refrigerate fresh; keep dried airtight and dark.
