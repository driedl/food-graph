Cashew shells contain urushiol-like compounds; nuts are always roasted/processed to remove caustic residues. Pistachios provide MUFA/PUFA, fiber, and minerals with a characteristic green pigment; shells aid mindful eating by slowing intake. Mango fruit offers fiber, carotenoids, and vitamin C; skin/contact can irritate sensitive individuals. Sumac spice adds tangy, anthocyanin-rich acidity. Allergies to tree nuts apply; cross-contact is common. Storage and shell closure ("split" vs closed) influence freshness and rancidity.
