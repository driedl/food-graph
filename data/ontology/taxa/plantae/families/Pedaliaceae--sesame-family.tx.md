Sesame seeds deliver healthy fats, protein, fiber, and minerals, with unhulled seeds retaining more calcium. Lignans (sesamin) and phytosterols characterize flavor and potential functional attributes. Toasting intensifies aroma but can reduce some heat-sensitive compounds; tahini concentrates calories and oils. Allergies occur in some populations; labeling is widely mandated. Oxidation control (freshness, dark packaging) preserves flavor and limits rancidity. Regional cultivars differ in color (white, black) and bitterness.
