_Culinary scope & forms._ Lightly toast kernels for pesto, pilaf, and desserts; fold into nougat and cookies; use resins sparingly in traditional preparations.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Delicate oils scorch fast—toast gently and watch closely. Add late for crunch; grind for creamy pastes.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Buttery, sweet nut flavor with soft crunch; small amounts lift sauces and sweets.

_Safety & handling._ Rare "pine mouth" taste disturbance occurs with some lots; source from reliable suppliers. Nuts rancidify quickly—store cold.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Species drive size and flavor (e.g., stone pine). Keep airtight and refrigerated; use promptly after opening.
