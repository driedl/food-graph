_Culinary scope & forms._ Crisp raw sticks and salads, caramelized roasts, butter-glazed sides, puréed soups, and juices showcase versatility. Tops mince into gremolata or pesto; small roots roast whole.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Roasting concentrates sweetness and browns edges; steaming preserves moisture; glazing balances salt, fat, and sugar for sheen. Shaving yields crisp slaws; don't overcook to mush.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Expect sweet-earthy flavor with aromatic terpenes; color varieties (orange, purple, yellow) hint at different flavor nuances and bitterness.

_Safety & handling._ Scrub or peel to remove soil. Tops can be assertive—blanch or mix with milder herbs. Avoid rubbery, dehydrated roots; they indicate age.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Fresh, young carrots are tender and sweet; storage carrots keep longer but can be starchier. Keep cold and humid; remove tops to prevent moisture loss.
