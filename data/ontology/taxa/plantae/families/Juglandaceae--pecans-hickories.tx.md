_Culinary scope & forms._ Pecans star in pies and pralines, enrich granolas, and crust fish and poultry; hickory nuts flavor confections and savory dishes; oils finish salads and desserts.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Gentle roasting develops aroma; avoid scorching delicate oils. Chop for crunchy inclusions; grind for buttery textures.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Rich, buttery nut flavor with caramel notes; oils carry pronounced fragrance that lifts sweets and salads.

_Safety & handling._ Tree-nut allergies apply. Rancidity develops in warm storageâ€”keep cool and airtight. Shell fragments should be screened.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar and freshness dictate sweetness and snap. Refrigerate or freeze kernels and oils for longevity.
