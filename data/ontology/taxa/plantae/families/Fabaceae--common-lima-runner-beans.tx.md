_Culinary scope & forms._ Soak and simmer for chilis, baked beans, and refritos; pressure-cook for speed. Fresh green beans blanch/sauté; runner beans slice for sautés and stews.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Salt soaking and gentle simmer improve skins; avoid acid early if you want tender seeds. Mash for spreads; leave intact for salads.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Creamy to mealy textures with earthy flavor; varieties differ in sweetness and aroma. Pair with aromatics, herbs, and cured meats for depth.

_Safety & handling._ Fully cook lima and kidney beans; undercooked seeds can be unpleasant. Rinse canned beans to moderate sodium.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Heirloom types vary widely in cook time and flavor. Store dried beans cool; rotate stock for even hydration.
