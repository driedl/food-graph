Olives supply MUFA-rich oils with phenolic compounds that drive peppery bitterness in extra-virgin grades; refining mellows flavor and reduces polyphenols. Table olives acquire flavor and safety through lye, brine, or natural fermentationsâ€”methods shift sodium and texture. Oils are heat-tolerant but lose volatile aromatics with prolonged high heat; reserve fragrant EVOO for finishing. Variety, harvest timing, and milling speed shape flavor and shelf life. Rinsing olives can reduce surface salt; storage in brine preserves quality. Pomace oils serve high-heat applications with milder taste.
