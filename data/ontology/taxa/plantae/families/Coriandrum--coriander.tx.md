_Culinary scope & forms._ Fresh leaves and tender stems finish salsas, salads, and curries; roots (where available) pound into pastes. Dried fruits (seeds) toast and grind for spice blends; whole seeds perfume pickles and broths.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Add leaves at the end to preserve perfume; prolonged heat mutes freshness. Toast seeds briefly to bloom oils, then grind; avoid scorching, which turns acrid.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Leaves provide bright, green-citrus aroma; seeds skew warm, nutty, and orange-zesty. Both contribute minimal bulk but strong flavor direction.

_Safety & handling._ A subset of people perceives soapy notes in leaves due to aroma sensitivityâ€”offer alternatives where needed. Rinse leaves well; they wilt fast.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Leafy bunches vary with season; store cold and upright in water or wrapped. Keep seeds whole and grind as needed; airtight storage preserves aroma.
