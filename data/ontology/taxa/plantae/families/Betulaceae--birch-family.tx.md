Hazelnuts offer MUFA-rich kernels with vitamin E, manganese, and fiber; roasting deepens aroma and loosens skins. They are energy-dense, so portion awareness helps. Oils are fragrant for dressings and pastry but less suited to prolonged high heat. Cross-allergy with other tree nuts can occur. Freshness (season, storage) strongly influences rancidity and texture. Birch sap and other family by-products exist but are niche in food usage.
