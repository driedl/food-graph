_Culinary scope & forms._ Serve fresh with cream or yogurt; macerate with sugar and acid for syrups; bake into shortcakes and tarts; cook quickly into jams; purée for sauces and ice creams.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Handle gently; chill but serve near cool room temperature for aroma. Quick cooking preserves color and fragrance; prolonged heat can dull flavor—add late to sauces.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Sweet-tart balance with intense perfume; flavor concentrates via dehydration or jam-making. Unripe fruit tastes grassy and less aromatic.

_Safety & handling._ Highly perishable; rinse just before use and drain well. Sort out soft fruit to limit mold spread.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Varieties vary in sweetness and aroma; field-ripened berries are most flavorful. Store cold and dry; eat promptly.
