summary: Climbing vines producing berries for fresh eating, raisins, juices, wines, vinegars, and brined leaves used as wraps; table and wine cultivars diverge in texture and chemistry.

_Culinary scope & forms._ Serve fresh; dry into raisins; press for juice and wine; ferment to vinegar; brine leaves for dolma-style rolls; use verjus from unripe grapes to season sauces.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Seeded grapes bring tannic bite; seedless favor snacking. Gentle heat collapses berries into sauces; roasting concentrates sweetness.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Sweet, floral profiles with skin-driven aroma; raisins concentrate sugars and chew; wines and vinegars carry complex fermentation notes.

_Safety & handling._ Rinse clusters; dry well to store. Watch sulfite sensitivity in some processed products; note seeds and skins in pur√©es.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Table vs wine grapes differ in brix, acidity, and texture. Refrigerate table grapes; cellar wines appropriately; keep leaves submerged in brine.
