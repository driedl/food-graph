Pine nuts offer buttery texture with MUFA, some PUFA, vitamin E, and minerals at high caloric density. Certain species/batches can cause transient "pine mouth" taste disturbance; sourcing and species metadata help avoidance. Light roasting develops flavor; overheating scorches delicate oils. Kernels rancidify quicklyâ€”cool storage and recent harvest matter. Oils suit dressings more than high-heat cooking. Shell fragments are uncommon but screening is part of quality control.
