_Culinary scope & forms._ Fresh fruit for snacking; bake into pies, cobblers, and tarts; poach and grill; dry into prunes and apricot halves; blanch and mill almonds for marzipan and pastries; press oils for finishing.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Freestone vs clingstone affects prep; ripe fruit softens rapidly with heat. Maceration draws juice for sauces; high-heat grilling caramelizes sugars. Almonds toast quickly—watch for scorching.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Juicy sweetness with floral notes in peaches and apricots; cherries range tart to sweet; almonds deliver rich, nutty depth to pastries and confections.

_Safety & handling._ Pits and some kernels contain amygdalin—do not eat stone centers from most fruit; commercial almonds are edible cultivars. Handle ripe fruit gently to avoid bruising.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar and ripeness dominate flavor and texture. Chill ripe fruit briefly; many types ripen best at room temperature, then refrigerate. Store nuts cool and airtight.
