Citrus delivers juice, pulp, and zest with bright acids and terpenes. Whole fruit supplies fiber (especially in pith) plus vitamin C, folate, and potassium; juices concentrate sugars while discarding most fiber. Flavanones and peel oils shape bitterness and aroma; zest carries intense flavor with negligible calories. Processing into marmalades, candied peel, and oils extends shelf life and use cases. Cultivar and ripeness determine sugar-acid balance; storage temperatures affect juiciness and volatile retention. Some medications interact with grapefruit compoundsâ€”downstream warnings can be species-specific.
