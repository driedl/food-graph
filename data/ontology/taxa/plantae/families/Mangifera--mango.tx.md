_Culinary scope & forms._ Ripe mango cubes and pur√©es sweeten lassi, ice creams, and sorbets; green mangoes pickle or shred for salads and curries. Dried slices and leathery pastes concentrate flavor; juices and nectars are common.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Ripe flesh is slippery and fibrous to silky depending on cultivar; chill softens aroma perception. High-heat caramelization creates jammy sauces; add late to preserve fragrance in curries.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Typically aromatic and sweet with tropical esters; green fruit presents tartness and crispness that play against salt, chili, and sugar in salads and pickles.

_Safety & handling._ Skin and sap can irritate sensitive skin due to related-plant compounds; peel carefully. Large central pits require specific cutting patterns. Sanitize knives after peeling sap-heavy fruits.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivars vary widely in fiber, perfume, and sweetness (e.g., fiberless dessert types vs stringier local varieties). Ripen at room temp, then chill. Handle gently to avoid bruising.
