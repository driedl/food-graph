_Culinary scope & forms._ Soak and simmer for stews, curries, and salads; pressure-cook for speed. Mash for hummus and chana masala; grind into besan for batters and flatbreads; roast for crunchy snacks.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Maintain shape with gentle simmer; overcooking yields creamy centers for purées. Reserve aquafaba for foams and meringues.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Firm bite with nutty flavor; flour brings earthy notes to batters and fritters. Takes bold spices well.

_Safety & handling._ Rinse canned chickpeas to moderate salt. Skins can be removed for ultra-smooth hummus but at time cost.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Desi vs kabuli types vary in size, color, and cook time. Store dried beans cool and dry; rotate stock for predictable cooking.
