_Culinary scope & forms._ Sage leaves fry crisp for garnishes, perfume brown butter for pasta, and season roasts and sausages; chia seeds thicken drinks and puddings or enrich breads.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Brief frying blooms sage's aroma; too much heat scorches. Chia hydrates into gel; combine with acids and sweeteners for balance.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Sage contributes resinous, piney notes; chia adds neutral nuttiness and pleasing gel structure to cold preparations.

_Safety & handling._ Essential oils are potentâ€”use sage judiciously. Hydrate chia before serving to avoid clumping.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Fresh vs dried sage differs in punch; keep dried airtight. Store chia seeds cool and sealed.
