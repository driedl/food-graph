Quinoa and amaranth provide complete-ish proteins and minerals; rinsing removes saponins that cause bitterness and foaming. Spinach/chard deliver folate, vitamin K, and nitrates, with oxalates that can limit calcium absorptionâ€”pair with dairy or choose lower-oxalate greens for balance. Pressure-cooking grains softens texture while preserving shape; toasting enhances aroma. Baby leaves suit raw salads; mature leaves prefer quick braises. Mineral density and earthy flavors vary by soil and cultivar. Storage cold and dry minimizes wilting and rancidity.
