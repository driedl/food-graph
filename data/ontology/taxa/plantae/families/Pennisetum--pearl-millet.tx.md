_Culinary scope & forms._ Cook whole grain like couscous or polenta for pilafs and porridges; grind into flour for flatbreads and batters; steam cracked grain for light, fluffy sides. Toasting dry grain before hydration deepens aroma.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Tiny grains hydrate fast; rest off heat to finish steaming and prevent gumminess. For breads, combine millet flour with binders or other grains to avoid crumbling; pregelatinize a portion for tenderness.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Mild, slightly nutty flavor that plays well with acids, spices, and braised vegetables. Whole-grain forms add satisfying body without heaviness; flours lend sandy crumb unless balanced.

_Safety & handling._ Rinse to remove dust; fine screens help. Store flour cool to prevent rancidity. Not naturally containing glutenâ€”avoid cross-contact if cooking for gluten-free needs.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Pearl vs other types vary in aroma and cook time. Keep grain dry and airtight; use freshly milled flour for best taste and structure.
