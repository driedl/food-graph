_Culinary scope & forms._ Simmer whole grain for salads and pilafs; grind into flour for flatbreads and batters; pop like popcorn for crunchy snacks; reduce sweet sorghum juice into syrup for baking.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Soak to shorten cook time; pressure-cook for speed. Whole kernels stay pleasantly chewy; combine flours with binders in gluten-free loaves to avoid crumbling.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Mild, grainy sweetness with faint tannic notes in some varieties; darker pericarps taste more robust. Syrup contributes caramel and minerality.

_Safety & handling._ Naturally gluten-freeâ€”avoid cross-contact if necessary. Rinse whole grain to shed dust; some varieties have a slight bitterness unless well cooked.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ White, red, and black types differ in flavor and color. Store grains dry; keep flours airtight and cool.
