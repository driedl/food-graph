Aster vegetables emphasize hydration and crunch (lettuces), bitters (chicories), and prebiotic inulin (artichokes). Seeds (sunflower) are energy-dense with vitamin E, PUFA, and phytosterols; seed butters and oils extend usage. Blanching or grilling tempers bitterness; raw salads preserve vitamin C and folate. Cynarin-driven artichoke flavors pair with fats and acids. Seed roasting boosts aroma but can reduce heat-sensitive compounds. Field age and cultivar shape bitterness, color, and texture.
