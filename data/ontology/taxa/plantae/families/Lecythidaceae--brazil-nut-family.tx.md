Brazil nuts deliver concentrated calories from fats along with selenium so high that 1–2 nuts can meet daily needs. They also supply protein, fiber, magnesium, and vitamin E. Overconsumption risks excessive selenium—portion guidance helps. Shell hardness drives processing labor; freshness affects rancidity due to high unsaturation. Roasting enhances flavor but can reduce some heat-sensitive nutrients. Origin and storage conditions influence aflatoxin risk; reputable sourcing and testing are important.
