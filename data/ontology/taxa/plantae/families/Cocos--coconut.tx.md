_Culinary scope & forms._ Young nuts provide sweet water and spoonable jelly; mature nuts yield grated flesh for curries and sweets, coconut milk/cream for sauces, and desiccated flakes for baking. Oils serve sautéing and pastry; sugar is derived from sap in related processes.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Toasting flakes and grated coconut develops nutty aroma; simmering milk/cream thickens curries and desserts. Avoid boiling oil-rich mixtures too hard to prevent splitting; stabilize with gentle heat and emulsifiers.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Presents rich, creamy mouthfeel in milk/cream and concentrated fat in oil; water is lightly sweet and refreshing. Desiccated products are dense and aromatic.

_Safety & handling._ Handle whole nuts with care when opening. Milk/cream can separate—shake or stir. Watch for spoilage in fresh products; canned goods are stable until opened.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Maturity drives sweetness and fat content; origin influences aroma. Store milk/cream chilled after opening; keep flakes and flours airtight; use oils before they stale.
