_Culinary scope & forms._ Dessert bananas eat fresh, blend, and bake; plantains fry, roast, or boil for savory sides; chips and dried slices concentrate sweetness; leaves wrap steaming and grilling.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Ripening converts starch to sugar—choose stage for use. Fry twice for tostones crunch; roast plantains to caramel. Avoid chilling injury in green fruit.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Banana flavor ranges from creamy to tangy; plantains skew savory-starchy and pair with salt, fat, and acid.

_Safety & handling._ Peel safely; sticky latex can stain knives on green fruit. Leaves are inedible but aromatic.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivars vary in sweetness and acidity. Ripen at room temp; refrigerate ripe fruit briefly; keep plantains warm to ripen.
