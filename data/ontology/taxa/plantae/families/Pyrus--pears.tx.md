_Culinary scope & forms._ Slice fresh with cheese and nuts; poach in spiced wine; bake into tarts and cakes; dry for chewy snacks; purée into sauces and butters.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Many pears ripen off tree—press near stem for readiness. Poaching keeps shape while infusing flavor; overbaking turns grainy types mushy.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Delicate floral sweetness with soft, buttery textures at peak; skins add aroma and tannic grip. Less acidic than apples, so blends balance jams.

_Safety & handling._ Wash before cutting; core and gritty stone cells are normal in some cultivars. Brown easily—use acidulated water.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Bartlett softens quickly; Bosc holds shape when cooked. Ripen at room temp; refrigerate ripe fruit to hold.
