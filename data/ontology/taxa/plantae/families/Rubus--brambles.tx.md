_Culinary scope & forms._ Fresh berries for bowls and desserts; cook quickly into coulis and jams; bake into crumbles and hand pies; strain seeds for smooth sauces if desired.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Extremely delicate—minimal handling preserves shape. Quick heat collapses drupelets into vivid sauces; sugar maceration draws syrup without cooking.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Tart-sweet foresty profile with floral high notes; seeds add crunch and slight bitterness—strain for refined textures.

_Safety & handling._ Mold spreads rapidly; sort and chill promptly. Rinse just before serving and drain well.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar and ripeness control sweetness and perfume. Store cold and dry; use fast or freeze on trays.
