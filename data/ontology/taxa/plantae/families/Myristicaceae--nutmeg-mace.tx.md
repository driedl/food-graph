_Culinary scope & forms._ Grate whole nutmeg into cream sauces, custards, and sweets; use mace for a lighter, floral warmth in charcuterie and baked goods. Infuse in syrups and punches.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Freshly grated spice is most aromatic; add late to preserve top notes. Avoid excessive heat that volatilizes aroma.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Highly potent aromatics used in pinches; mace reads lighter and lemony compared to nutmeg's deeper warmth.

_Safety & handling._ Excessive intake is unsafe; use culinary amounts only. Store whole seeds airtight and dark.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Origin influences oil content and fragrance. Whole spices keep far longer than ground.
