Brassicas offer leaves (kale, cabbage), inflorescences (broccoli, cauliflower), stems (kohlrabi), and pungent roots (radish, horseradish). They're low-calorie and fiber-rich, with vitamin C/K and folate; glucosinolates convert (via myrosinase) to isothiocyanates that shape aroma and may confer benefits. Chopping then briefly cooking preserves enzyme activity; steaming loses fewer nutrients than long boiling. Fermentation (kimchi, sauerkraut) adds probiotics and extends shelf life. Bitterness varies by cultivar and season; frost can sweeten greens. Sensitive individuals may experience gas from raffinose-family sugars.
