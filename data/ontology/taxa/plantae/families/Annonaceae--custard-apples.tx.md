Cherimoya, soursop, and relatives offer creamy textures with floral aromas; pulp is scooped or blended into sweets and drinks. They provide vitamin C, potassium, and fiber with moderate natural sugars. Seeds and leaves contain acetogenins and are not consumed; careful separation is standard. Chilling alters textureâ€”brief refrigeration helps, long cold can cause browning. Regional cultivars vary in aroma intensity, acidity, and seed-to-pulp ratio. Pulp oxidizes quickly once opened; acidulation (lime) helps maintain color.
