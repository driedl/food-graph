_Culinary scope & forms._ Cashew kernels roast for snacks, grind into creamy pastes and pralines, and blend into sauces or non-dairy "cheeses." Cashew apples press into juices and fermented drinks in producing regions.

_Texture & cooking logic._ High natural creaminess supports smooth purées and stable emulsions. Light roasting deepens aroma; over-roasting scorches quickly. Soaking softens kernels for blending.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Kernels offer rich mouthfeel and mild sweetness; apples bring perfumed juice with astringency unless processed. Oil content drives satiating textures.

_Safety & handling._ Raw shells contain caustic compounds; commercial kernels are always heat-processed to remove residues. Tree-nut allergies apply; cross-contact is common in facilities.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Origin and grade affect size, color, and flavor. Store kernels cool and airtight to prevent rancidity; vacuum packs extend freshness. Apples are highly perishable—use or process promptly.
