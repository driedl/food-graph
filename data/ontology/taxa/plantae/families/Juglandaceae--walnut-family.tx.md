Walnuts are notable for plant omega-3 ALA; pecans lean MUFA and have buttery sweetness. Both offer fiber, protein, vitamin E, and minerals at high energy density. Toasting improves flavor but risks scorching; gentle heat is best. Shelling quality and freshness determine rancidity and bitterness. Cross-contact with other tree nuts is a common labeling concern. Oils amplify flavor in dressings but are less suited to high-heat cooking.
