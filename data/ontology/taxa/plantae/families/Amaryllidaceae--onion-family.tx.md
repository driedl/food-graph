Alliums develop allicin and related compounds when cut or crushed; resting chopped garlic/onion briefly before cooking maximizes these reactions. They're low-calorie flavor bases supplying fructans (prebiotic fibers) and trace minerals. Slow cooking caramelizes sugars; high heat browns quickly for saut√©s. Some individuals experience FODMAP sensitivity and prefer green tops or infused oils. Storage cool and dry extends life; refrigeration can soften texture in certain varieties. Fermented forms (black garlic) shift flavor and texture dramatically.
