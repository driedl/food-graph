_Culinary scope & forms._ Roast lightly for snacks; chop into cookies and crusts; blend into smooth butters; press oils for salads and pastry; candy or salt for bar mixes.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Delicate oils scorch quickly—toast gently, stirring often. For brittles and pralines, fold in at the end to preserve crunch; coarse chops maintain texture in bakes.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Rich, mellow sweetness with creamy mouthfeel; small amounts deliver big flavor impact in desserts and salads.

_Safety & handling._ Tree-nut allergies apply. Nuts go rancid with heat and time—store cool and airtight; refrigerate oils and pastes.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar and roast level steer flavor; fresh-crop nuts taste brightest. Keep sealed; use within a reasonable window for peak aroma.
