Grains are carbohydrate staples with variable protein quality and fiber depending on refinement. Whole grains retain bran/germ (fiber, B-vitamins, minerals) but more phytate; milling removes fiber and micronutrients (often re-added via fortification). Gluten occurs in wheat/barley/rye; corn and rice are gluten-free. Processing (malting, nixtamalization, parboiling) shifts flavor, digestibility, and micronutrient availability. Oil extraction (corn/bran oils) concentrates calories and alters fatty-acid intake. Storage, milling date, and grind affect rancidity and cooking performance.
