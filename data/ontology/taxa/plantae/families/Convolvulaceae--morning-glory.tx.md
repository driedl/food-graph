Sweet potatoes provide starchy roots rich in carotenoids (orange types) or anthocyanins (purple types) plus fiber and potassium. Baking concentrates sweetness; steaming retains moisture; cooling and reheating can raise resistant starch. Skins add minerals and fiber if well cleaned. Leaves are tender greens after brief sauté or simmer. Cultivar, curing, and storage shape sweetness and texture. Sprouting and chilling damage degrade quality—store cool but not cold.
