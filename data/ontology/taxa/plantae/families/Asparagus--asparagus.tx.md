_Culinary scope & forms._ Spears roast, grill, sauté, or blanch for salads, pastas, and sides; white asparagus is peeled and often simmered with buttery sauces; purple types are sweeter and cook quickly.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Snap or trim woody ends; peel thicker stalks for even tenderness. Cook just until crisp-tender to preserve snap and aroma; overcooking dulls color and softens excessively.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Offers a clean, green sweetness with gentle bitterness; inulin-type components contribute body in purées; sulfurous volatiles appear during cooking.

_Safety & handling._ Rinse tips carefully; grit hides in bracts. Red berries on ornamental plants are not for eating. Serve promptly; aroma fades if held hot too long.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Thickness and freshness dictate cooking time; store upright, stems moistened, and chilled. Seasonality and field handling drive sweetness and tenderness.
