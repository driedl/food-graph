_Culinary scope & forms._ Beet roots roast, steam, or braise for salads, dips, and sides; pickling is common. Golden and striped cultivars reduce staining compared with red types. Swiss chard and beet greens sauté, braise, or fold into soups; stems benefit from a head start.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Roasting concentrates sugars and earthy aromatics; steaming preserves moisture for purées. Thin shaving yields crisp raw salads. Greens wilt quickly; finish with acid and fat for gloss. Color bleeds into cooking water—roast or steam whole to retain.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Roots present sweet-earthy character with earthy volatiles; greens offer a tender, mineral-forward bite. Oxalates are higher in some leaves; pairing with dairy or thorough cooking can moderate assertiveness.

_Safety & handling._ Red varieties stain boards and hands—use lined surfaces and gloves if desired. Rinse sand from crowns and stems. Leaves can be bitter when very mature; trim and cook appropriately.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar, soil, and age drive sweetness and earthiness. Store roots cool and humid; remove tops to prevent moisture loss. Keep greens cold and use quickly; young leaves are milder and more tender.
