Blueberries and cranberries provide vitamin C, fiber, and polyphenols (e.g., anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins). Drying and sweetening increase calorie density; juices lose most fiber. Freezing preserves nutrients and convenience with minimal texture loss in smoothies and bakes. Cranberry's sharp acidity pairs with sugar and savory fats. Cultivar and growing region alter size, skin thickness, and flavor intensity. Storage cold and dry limits mold; washing just before use preserves shelf life.
