_Culinary scope & forms._ Simmer until grains split and curl; blend with white rice for textural contrast; fold into stuffings and cold salads; pop in hot oil for crunchy garnishes; grind for batters.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Longer cooking yields tender chew; excess heat can burst grains into fluff. Toast dry briefly before simmering to amplify aroma; drain rather than absorb for consistent doneness.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Robust, tea-like aroma with nutty sweetness; darker varieties taste earthier. Small portions add aroma and chew to simple dishes.

_Safety & handling._ Rinse to remove chaff; pick for stones if wild-harvested. Store cooked grains chilled; they firm upâ€”refresh with stock.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Hand-parched vs mechanically processed differs in aroma and cook time. Keep dry grain cool and sealed.
