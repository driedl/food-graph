_Culinary scope & forms._ Rinse and steam for fluffy sides; cook into breakfast porridges; blend into flatbread doughs; toast lightly for nutty aromas.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Very fast cooking; use fine sieves when rinsing. Rest after steaming to set; fluff with forks to keep grains separate.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Mild and slightly nutty; takes on sauces and aromatics readily without heaviness.

_Safety & handling._ Stones and chaff can appearâ€”rinse and pick over. Avoid overcooking to mush.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ White vs brown types differ subtly. Store dry and cool; rotate for freshness.
