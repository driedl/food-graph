Cucurbits range from crisp, hydrating cucumbers and melons to dense winter squash suited for roasting and purees. Seeds (pumpkin, squash) deliver protein, PUFA, magnesium, and phytosterols; pepitas and seed butters are common derivatives. Winter types contribute fiber and carotenoids; summer types cook quickly with delicate skins. Rare bitterness signals cucurbitacinsâ€”avoid those fruits. Storage life and sweetness vary by cultivar and harvest maturity. Seed oils and roasted seeds add concentrated calories and flavor.
