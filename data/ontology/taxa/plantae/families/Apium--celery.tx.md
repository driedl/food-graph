_Culinary scope & forms._ Stalk celery adds crunch to salads and dips, forms mirepoix with onion and carrot, and braises tender. Leaves season stocks and salads. Celeriac roasts, mashes, or purées into veloutés; celery seed spices rubs and pickles.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Stalks soften with heat and retain pleasant bite if not overcooked; strings peel easily for refined textures. Celeriac benefits from peeling deep to remove pithy outer layers.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Characteristic herbal-saline aroma defines flavor; celeriac offers a starchy-sweet profile compared with leafy forms. Seeds are intensely aromatic and used sparingly.

_Safety & handling._ Some diners are sensitive to strong celery aromatics. Wash sand from inner ribs; trim oxidized celeriac promptly to prevent browning.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Field-grown vs blanched celery differ in color and intensity. Store stalks cold and humid; celeriac holds well refrigerated; celery seed keeps best airtight and dark.
