_Culinary scope & forms._ Baby leaves finish salads, sandwiches, and pizzas; mature bunches wilt into hot pastas and eggs. Flowers and small pods garnish with gentle heat and color.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Dress at the last moment to keep lift; quick sauté tames heat without limpness. Pair with citrus, parmesan, nuts, and olive oil for balance.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Characteristically peppery-mustardy aroma; older leaves taste bolder, baby leaves milder and sweeter. Oils and dairy carry volatile notes well.

_Safety & handling._ Wash thoroughly; tender leaves bruise easily. Some diners find raw arugula intensely pungent—mix with milder greens when needed.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Wild vs cultivated types vary in intensity. Keep cold and dry; use within a few days for best crunch.
