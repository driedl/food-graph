_Culinary scope & forms._ Fresh wedges, rings for grill/roast, salsas with chili and herbs, upside-down cakes, sorbets, and canned slices or crushed fruit. Cores flavor syrups and vinegars; peels can ferment for tepache.

_Texture & cooking logic._ High heat caramelizes sugars for jammy edges; brief cooking preserves perfume. Bromelain tenderizes meats but can soften gels—add late if needed.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Bright aromatics with pronounced sweetness balanced by acidity; dried forms concentrate flavor and chew. Juices provide intense pineapple character for drinks and glazes.

_Safety & handling._ Spines and eyes require careful trimming. Enzymes can irritate mouth—rinse or pair with fat/dairy to soften perception.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Varieties differ in sweetness, fiber, and aroma; ripen mostly on plant. Hold at cool room temperature briefly; refrigerate cut fruit.
