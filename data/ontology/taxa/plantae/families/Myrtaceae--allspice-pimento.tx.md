_Culinary scope & forms._ Use whole berries in pickles and stews; grind for baking and spice rubs; key to jerk seasoning and mulled drinks. Works with citrus, rum, and grilled meats.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Toast lightly to bloom aroma; grind fresh for intensity. Whole berries infuse slowly and strain easily.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Warm, rounded spice notes unify sweet and savory dishes; small amounts steer flavor strongly.

_Safety & handling._ Ground spice stales quicklyâ€”store airtight. Use judiciously to avoid overpowering delicate foods.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Jamaican origins are classic; other regions vary in oil content. Keep whole berries dry and dark.
