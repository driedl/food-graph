_Culinary scope & forms._ Simmer for hearty soups and pilafs; toast and crack for breads; malt for brewing and sweet syrups; use flakes in breakfast blends.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Soak for even cooking; simmer gently to keep chew; rinse to remove surface starch for salads.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Pleasantly nutty with a satisfying chew; malt adds sweetness and roasted aromas to beverages and bakes.

_Safety & handling._ Contains gluten; not suited for gluten-free diets. Store dry; cooked barley holds well chilled.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Pearl vs hulled changes time and texture. Keep grains cool and airtight; use malt fresh for aroma.
