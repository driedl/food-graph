Chestnuts differ from most nuts—lower fat, higher starch—with fiber and vitamin C (in fresh). Acorns and beechnuts require leaching/soaking or fermentation to reduce tannins and bitterness before milling or cooking. Roasting converts starches and deepens sweetness; boiling preserves moisture for purees. Flours from these nuts enrich breads and pastas with unique aroma. Mineral content is solid but phytates can limit absorption; traditional processing helps. Harvest handling and drying determine mold risk and shelf life.
