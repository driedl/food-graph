_Culinary scope & forms._ Seeds roast and salt for snacking, grind into butter, or top breads and salads; oils dress and sauté. Jerusalem artichokes (sunchokes) roast, pan-fry, pickle, or purée into soups; raw slices add crunch to salads.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Seeds toast quickly—watch for scorching. Sunchokes brown nicely and can soften to creamy centers; slicing evenly ensures consistent doneness. Acidulated water limits browning of cut tubers.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Seeds provide rich, nutty flavor and satisfying crunch; tubers carry a faint sweetness with a distinctive artichoke-like aroma from inulin and volatiles.

_Safety & handling._ Some diners experience gas from inulin-rich sunchokes—try smaller portions or thorough cooking. Shell fragments should be screened from seeds; oil can go rancid if stored warm.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Seed varieties differ in size and flavor; tuber cultivars vary in knobbiness and sweetness. Store seeds airtight and cool; keep tubers cold and dry; use oils before staling.
