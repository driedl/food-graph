_Culinary scope & forms._ Peanuts roast and salt for snacks, boil fresh in shell, grind into butter and satay sauces, and candy into brittles; oils fry and dress. Defatted flours add body to baked goods.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Roast to desired color and snap; avoid scorching skins. Grinding releases oils for smooth pastes; emulsify with a little sweetener or salt for stability.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Characteristically roasty, nutty profile with satisfying crunch; oils give rich mouthfeel. Savory sauces take chili, lime, and aromatics well.

_Safety & handling._ Peanut allergy is common; manage cross-contact. Aflatoxin risk exists in poorly stored lotsâ€”buy reputable brands and store cool and dry.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Varietals (Runner, Virginia, Spanish) differ in size and flavor. Keep nuts airtight; refrigerate butters if natural/unemulsified.
