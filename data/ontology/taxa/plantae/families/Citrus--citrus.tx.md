_Culinary scope & forms._ Juice and zest for dressings, cocktails, and desserts; supremes for salads; candied peel and marmalade for baking; preserved lemons for braises; essential oils and extracts for concentrated aroma.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Zest carries intense volatile oils—use microplanes or strips; avoid bitter pith unless desired. Heat dulls fresh top notes; add zest late or finish with fresh juice.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Bright acids and terpene-driven perfume define character; sweetness and bitterness vary by type (e.g., sweet orange vs grapefruit).

_Safety & handling._ Wash rinds before zesting; grapefruit compounds interact with some medications—flag at deeper species nodes. Juice quickly oxidizes—serve fresh.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Variety and ripeness set sugar-acid balance and peel thickness. Store whole fruit cool; refrigerate cut fruit.
