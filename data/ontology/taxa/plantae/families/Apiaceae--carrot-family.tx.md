Carrots supply provitamin A and fiber; color types vary in carotenoids and anthocyanins. Celery contributes hydration, potassium, and distinctive aroma; leaves and seeds season stocks. Parsley provides vitamin K and bright herbal notes. Seed spices (cumin, coriander, fennel) are concentrated in flavor with minor caloric impact; toasting blooms volatiles. Nitrate-rich celery powders appear in curing; label literacy helps sodium management. Texture and sweetness in roots depend on storage, variety, and harvest timing.
