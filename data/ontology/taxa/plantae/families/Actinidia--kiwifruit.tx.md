_Culinary scope & forms._ Fruits range from classic green, tangy types to sweeter, less acidic golden cultivars. They're eaten fresh by the spoonful, sliced into salads and pavlovas, blended into smoothies and sorbets, or juiced; jams and chutneys show up regionally.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Ripe kiwifruit offers soft, juicy flesh with edible seeds; chilling firms texture but mutes aroma. Gentle heat for compotes is fine, but prolonged cooking dulls brightness; add late to preserve fragrance. Enzyme activity can soften gelatin and curdle fresh dairyâ€”time additions accordingly.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Typical patterns include high water content with notable acidity and a fragrant, tropical profile; seeds contribute a trace of seed oil feel on the palate. Green types carry actinidin protease; golden types skew toward sweeter perception.

_Safety & handling._ Some individuals experience oral irritation or allergy-like reactions, often reduced by peeling or light cooking. Wash skins before cutting. For raw dairy uses, test stability or add fruit just before serving to avoid curdling.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar and ripeness determine sweetness, acidity, and color. Ripen at room temperature, then refrigerate to hold; ethylene exposure (bananas) speeds ripeness. Handle gently to prevent bruising; use within a few days once ripe.
