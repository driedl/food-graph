_Culinary scope & forms._ Kernels roast and salt for snacks, grind into smooth pastes for chocolates and spreads, and top baked goods. Oils perfume dressings and pastry creams; chopped nuts add crunch to crusts and salads.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Roast gently to loosen skins and develop aroma; rub in towels to peel. Over-roasting scorches quickly. Pastes emulsify into ganache and ice cream; coarse chops keep crunch.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Rich, buttery kernels with a characteristic sweet-nut aroma; oils carry strong fragrance that elevates desserts and salads.

_Safety & handling._ Tree-nut allergies apply. Watch for rancidity in warm storage; molds are a risk in poorly dried lots. Blanching aids skin removal but can mute flavor if overdone.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar and origin set size and flavor; fresh-crop nuts taste brighter. Store cool and airtight; refrigerate pastes and oils; use within reasonable time to avoid staling.
