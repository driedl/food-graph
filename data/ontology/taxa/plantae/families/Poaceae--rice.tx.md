_Culinary scope & forms._ Steam jasmine and basmati for fragrant sides; cook sticky rice for sushi and sweets; fry day-old rice; grind into rice flour and noodles; parboil for firmer grains.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Wash to desired clarity; soak where traditional; rest after steaming for even moisture. Use absorption or pilaf methods to control texture.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Flavor varies from floral aromatics to neutral backdrops; brown forms taste nuttier with more chew; sticky varieties excel in molded and handheld dishes.

_Safety & handling._ Cool cooked rice promptly to avoid spoilage; reheat thoroughly. Check fortification if using as a base in restricted diets.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar drives length, aroma, and stickiness. Store dry and sealed; rotate stock; refrigerate brown rice to prevent rancidity.
