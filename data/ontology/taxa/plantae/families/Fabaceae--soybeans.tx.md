_Culinary scope & forms._ Fresh edamame boil/steam; soy milk coagulates into tofu; fermented products include tempeh, miso, natto, and soy sauce; textured proteins extend ground dishes; oils cook and dress.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Tofu ranges from silken to extra-firm based on coagulant and water; pressing concentrates; searing builds crust. Fermentations deepen umami and saltiness.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Neutral to beany base takes on marinades; fermentation layers savory complexity. Soy sauce and miso deliver concentrated umami and salt.

_Safety & handling._ Soy allergy occurs in some; fermented products are typically saltyâ€”balance recipes accordingly. Keep fresh tofu refrigerated in water; change water to extend life.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar and processing define flavor and texture; non-GMO/organic options exist. Store dried/fermented goods cool and airtight; refrigerate opened sauces and miso.
