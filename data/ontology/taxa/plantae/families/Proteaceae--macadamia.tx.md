Macadamias are MUFA-dominant with minimal carbohydrate, delivering rich texture ideal for roasting, nut butters, and desserts. They provide manganese, thiamin, and fiber alongside high energy density—small portions go far. Light roasting develops flavor while preserving delicate oils; high heat risks scorching. Shelling and sorting quality impact freshness and "soapiness" defects. Oils have high smoke points suitable for sautéing; cold-pressed variants emphasize aroma. Cross-contamination with other tree nuts is a labeling consideration.
