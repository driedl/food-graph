_Culinary scope & forms._ Boil groats for pilafs and salads; toast (kasha) for deeper flavor; mill into flour for crepes, pancakes, noodles, and quick breads. Blend with other flours for tenderness.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Rinse to reduce surface starch; avoid overcooking groats to mush. For soba, control hydration and rest dough; 100% buckwheat is delicate—many noodles blend wheat for strength.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Strong, nutty-earthy flavor with slight bitterness; toasting amplifies aroma. Adds body and color to batters and noodles.

_Safety & handling._ Naturally gluten-free—prevent cross-contact if needed. Some diners are sensitive to hulls; use hulled groats for softer textures.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Light vs dark flours differ in bitterness; recent milling tastes fresher. Store flour cool; keep groats dry.
