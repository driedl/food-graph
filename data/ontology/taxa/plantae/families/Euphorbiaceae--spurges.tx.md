Cassava is a staple starch that requires proper processing to reduce cyanogenic glycosidesâ€”traditional soaking, fermenting, and thorough cooking are key. Cooked then cooled cassava develops resistant starch, altering texture and glycemic impact. Flours vary by fermentation (sour vs sweet), affecting flavor and functionality in breads and pancakes. Frying raises energy density substantially; steaming/boiling keeps it moderate. Leafy tops are edible after cooking and offer additional micronutrients. Provenance and cultivar influence dryness, sweetness, and cooking time.
