_Culinary scope & forms._ Boil or grill fresh ears; dry and nixtamalize for hominy and masa; cook grits/polenta; bake with cornmeal; pop kernels; press germ for oil; reduce sap into syrups in related processes.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Alkaline nixtamalization loosens hulls and improves dough behavior; grind wet for masa or dry for flour. Control polenta texture with slow simmer and resting; season generously.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Sweet fresh kernels vs toasty, mineral masa; cornmeal leans buttery and coarse unless finely milled. Blue and red varieties add earthy notes and striking color.

_Safety & handling._ Cool cooked corn promptly. Dry products keep wellâ€”watch for rancidity in germ-rich meals. Masa and tortillas can be sodium-moderate unless heavily salted.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Flint, dent, flour, and sweet types differ in starch and texture. Store meals airtight and cool; keep whole kernels dry.
