_Culinary scope & forms._ Mung beans sprout for crisp salads and stir-fries; whole or split cook into soups and dals. Adzuki sweeten into pastes for confections; cowpeas simmer into stews and hoppin' john.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Small seeds cook quickly without soaking; skim foam. Sprouts stay crisp with brief high heat or raw rinses.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Mild, slightly grassy flavor (mung), nutty earthiness (adzuki, cowpea). Sprouting freshens and lightens perception.

_Safety & handling._ Use clean water for sprouting; refrigerate promptly. Some varieties foam—use larger pots.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Regional landraces differ in color and aroma. Store dry and cool; use sprouts within days.
