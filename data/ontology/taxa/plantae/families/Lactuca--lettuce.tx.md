_Culinary scope & forms._ Crispheads add crunch; romaine grills or chops for hearty salads; butterheads bring tender leaves for wraps; looseleaf mixes diversify textures. Hearts grill briefly; outer leaves wilt into warm salads and soups.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Keep very cold for snap; dress just before serving to avoid sog. High heat briefly chars romaine without full collapse. Spin dry after washing to keep dressings clinging.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Light, refreshing flavor with subtle bitterness in some types; pale hearts are milder, darker leaves more aromatic. Minimal bulk needed to add volume and freshness.

_Safety & handling._ Wash thoroughly to remove soil; handle cross-contamination risks like any ready-to-eat produce. Dry well to prevent dilution and spoilage.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Cultivar and field conditions drive sweetness and bitterness. Store cold and uncrushed with airflow; avoid ethylene exposure to prevent rusting and browning.
