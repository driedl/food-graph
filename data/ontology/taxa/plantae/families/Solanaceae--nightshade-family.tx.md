Tomatoes excel in sauces and salads; cooking in oil increases lycopene availability and concentrates flavor. Potatoes are potassium-rich staples whose glycoalkaloids rise in greened or sprouted tubersâ€”discard those. Chilies deliver capsaicin heat; drying and smoking create ancho/chipotle styles with different aroma and heat. Eggplant improves with salting and high-heat roasting to collapse cell structure. Peppers and tomatoes add vitamin C and carotenoids at low calories. Variety and maturity dictate sweetness, heat, and texture.
