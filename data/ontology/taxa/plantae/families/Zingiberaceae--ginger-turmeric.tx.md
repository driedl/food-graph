Ginger, turmeric, and cardamom are low-calorie but flavor-dense ingredients. Ginger's gingerols/shogaols bring heat; turmeric's curcuminoids color fats and stews; cardamom pods supply resinous, floral notes. Bioactives dissolve into hot fat or alcohol; dry heat blooms spices before liquid additions. Turmeric pairs with pepper and fat for better use in dishes; fresh ginger offers enzymatic tenderizing for meats. Powders lose aroma faster than whole roots/podsâ€”grind close to use. Staining and strong aromas call for careful storage and handling.
