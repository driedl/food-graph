_Culinary scope & forms._ Snack roasted or chop into biscotti and cakes; grind into pralines and nut butters; use oils for dressings and pastry. Pairs with chocolate and caramel.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Roast lightly to avoid waxy texture without scorching delicate oils. Chop or slice for controlled crunch; grind when fresh to prevent bitterness.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Buttery, faintly woody aroma with rich mouthfeel; small amounts deliver strong flavor in sweets and crusts.

_Safety & handling._ Tree-nut allergies apply. Buy from reputable sources to reduce mold risk; store cool and airtight to prevent rancidity.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Harvest and storage conditions drive freshness. Refrigerate or freeze kernels and oils for longevity.
