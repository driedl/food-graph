_Culinary scope & forms._ Shelled kernels and pastes color and flavor baklava, nougat, pralines, and gelato; chopped nuts crust meats and fish; oils finish salads and desserts with distinctive aroma.

_Texture & cooking logic._ Gentle roasting unlocks sweetness and aroma; overheating browns quickly and can turn bitter. Paste integrates into ganache and custards; coarsely chopped nuts add crunch.

_Nutrition patterns (high-level)._ Kernels deliver a buttery-yet-firm bite with a subtly resinous, green flavor; oil content supports creamy textures in pastries and ice creams.

_Safety & handling._ Tree-nut allergies apply. Watch for dyed shells in some markets; quality varies by harvest and handling. Keep products dry to prevent mold; rancidity rises with heat and oxygen.

_Variability, sourcing & storage._ Origin and cultivar set color intensity and flavor; open-shell ("naturally split") nuts are preferred. Store cool and airtight; refrigerate pastes and oils for longevity.
