Plants are primary producers; most edible tissues are high in water and carbohydrate, naturally low in sodium, and generally rich in potassium. Leaves and stems trend higher in fiber and certain folates; fruits concentrate sugars and vitamin C; seeds and nuts pack energy (oils) and minerals with phytate-bound micronutrients; legumes stand out for protein quality among plants. Key lipid signals (e.g., MUFA in olives/avocado, omega-6 in many seeds, ALA in some seeds) and a wide array of phytochemicals (polyphenols, carotenoids, glucosinolates) are kingdom signatures users will see repeated down-branch.
