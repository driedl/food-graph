summary: Poultry tends to be lean with low myoglobin; skin drives fat, and eggs add complete protein, choline, and fat-soluble vitamins.

Birds (poultry) yield generally leaner meats with lower myoglobin than mammalian "red meats." Skin/fat layer is a major driver of energy density; removing skin shifts macros toward higher protein per calorie. Eggs are a distinct food system: complete protein, significant choline, and fat-soluble vitamins concentrated in the yolk, with fatty acid profiles influenced by the hen's diet.
