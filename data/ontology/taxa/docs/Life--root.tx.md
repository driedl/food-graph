summary: Root of all edible biodiversity in the graph, carrying no nutrient priors but anchoring inheritance of traits below.

"Life" is the root of the treeâ€”a placeholder for all edible biodiversity your graph will traverse. It carries no nutrient priors itself, but it reminds users that every food inherits constraints from where it sits in the tree. As you descend, broad biological rules start to shape expected macronutrients (carb/fat/protein), water content, minerals, and bioactive compounds.
