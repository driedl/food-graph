summary: All foods with nuclei; storage molecules and sterols diverge here (plant starch/phyto-sterols, animal glycogen/cholesterol, fungal glycogen/ergosterol).

Eukaryotes are organisms with nuclei and organelles, covering plants, animals, and fungiâ€”the scope of almost all foods people eat. Nutritionally, storage molecules diverge here: plants bias toward starch and oils (often in seeds), animals toward glycogen and fats, and fungi toward glycogen with cell walls made of chitin. Sterols also split: phytosterols (plants), cholesterol (animals), and ergosterol (fungi, precursor to vitamin D2). Expect the big nutritional patterns of each kingdom to emerge below this node.
