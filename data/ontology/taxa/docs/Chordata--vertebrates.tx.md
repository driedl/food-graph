summary: Vertebrates whose muscles share structure but differ in fat, myoglobin, and micronutrients; offal stands out for density.

Vertebrates (fishes, birds, mammals) offer structurally similar muscle foods but with different fat profiles, myoglobin levels (redness), and micronutrient patterns. Heme iron and zinc are generally higher than in plant foods; connective tissues introduce collagen/gelatin and glycine. Offal (liver, heart, kidney) is markedly nutrient-dense, while skeletal muscle varies from very lean (certain fishes, poultry breast) to fat-marbled (some mammals).
