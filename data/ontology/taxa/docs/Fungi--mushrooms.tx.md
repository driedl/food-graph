summary: Water-rich, low-calorie foods with modest protein, chitin/β-glucan fiber, strong umami, and UV-convertible ergosterol to vitamin D2.

Fungi (e.g., culinary mushrooms) tend to be water-rich, low-calorie foods with modest protein, very low fat, and meaningful fiber from chitin and β-glucans. They're notable for umami (free glutamates, nucleotides) that drive savoriness in recipes. Ergosterol in cell membranes can convert to vitamin D2 with UV exposure, and B-vitamin profiles can be decent relative to calories. As users drill into genera/species, expect small swings in texture, umami intensity, and fiber type rather than big macro shifts.
