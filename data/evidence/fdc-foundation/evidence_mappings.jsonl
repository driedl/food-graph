The original part_id (part:juice:pomegranate:from_concentrate:shelf_stable) is not in the ontology \u2014 map to the existing broad part 'part:expressed_juice'. The Tier 2 pipeline included fine-grained/invalid parameters (method='press/filtration', substrate=taxon) and an invalid transform (tf:reconstitute) and a non-standard evaporate param (target_brix). These introduce ontology/validation errors and would fragment buckets. Nutritionally, pomegranate juices 'from concentrate' that are reconstituted and pasteurized are effectively comparable to non-concentrate shelf-stable juices after reconstitution; therefore we avoid adding evaporate/reconstitute-specific parameters which would create narrow buckets. We keep broad, valid transforms that capture the key processing for a shelf-stable juice: straining/filtration (tf:strain), pasteurization (tf:pasteurize), and shelf-stable packaging/canning (tf:can). Params are left empty to avoid creating unnecessary parameter-level buckets. This preserves aggregation across juices with similar nutrient profiles while removing invalid/unsupported parameters and transforms.", "overlay_applied": false}
