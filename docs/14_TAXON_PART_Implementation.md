# 14 â€” Taxon+Part Search Implementation

**Status**: Phase 1 Complete âœ…  
**Author**: System  
**Date**: 2025-01-27 (Updated 2025-09-30)  
**Goal**: Enable search for "Milk", "Cow milk", "Goat milk", etc. by materializing taxon+part combinations as searchable nodes.

---

## Executive Summary

**Phase 1 is fully implemented and working** - users can now search for common food concepts like "Milk", "Eggs", "Apple", "Beef" and get intuitive taxon+part results. The system materializes 450+ taxon+part nodes with proper naming (implied parts, overrides) and unified search across taxa and food concepts.

**Current Status**: âœ… Complete - All functionality working, database sync resolved, legacy tables cleaned up  
**Phase 2**: Transform chains (e.g., "Buttermilk", "Yogurt") â€” deferred to future ADR

## Implementation Status (Updated 2025-01-27)

### âœ… **COMPLETED**

**ETL Pipeline:**

- âœ… `taxon_part_nodes` table with 450+ entries
- âœ… Separate FTS tables: `taxa_fts` (330 entries) + `tp_fts` (450 entries)
- âœ… Rules system implemented:
  - `implied_parts.jsonl` â€” 181 rules for implicit parts (e.g., "Apple" â†’ fruit)
  - `name_overrides.jsonl` â€” 102 rules for market names (e.g., "Beef", "Pork", "Cow Milk")
  - `taxon_part_policy.json` â€” Materialization policy (leaf-only by default)
  - `taxon_part_synonyms.jsonl` â€” Additional synonyms
- âœ… Name generation working with implied parts and overrides

**API Layer:**

- âœ… `search.combined` endpoint supports both `taxon` and `taxon_part` results
- âœ… `getTaxonPart` endpoint for detailed taxon+part information
- âœ… Proper ranking and deduplication
- âœ… Navigation objects for UI routing

**UI Layer:**

- âœ… Search results display taxon+part nodes with "Food" badges
- âœ… Unified treatment: UI treats TX/TP/TPT as backend concepts (no client routes)
- âœ… `onPickTP` handler navigates to workbench with taxon + part context
- âœ… Integration with existing workbench flow

### âœ… **ISSUES RESOLVED (2025-09-30)**

**Database Sync Problem:** âœ… FIXED

- ETL database has both FTS tables populated (`taxa_fts`: 330, `tp_fts`: 450)
- API database now properly synced with both FTS tables via `pnpm sync-db`
- Search using optimized FTS with BM25 ranking working correctly

**Legacy FTS Tables:** âœ… CLEANED UP

- Removed unused `taxon_doc_fts` and `nodes_fts_test` tables from compile.py
- Only active FTS tables remain: `taxa_fts` and `tp_fts`
- Database size reduced and cleaner schema

### ðŸ“‹ **FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS**

**Metadata/Backlog:**

- **Plant-part synonyms** (pulp/flesh/stone/bran/germ/greens, etc.) for better recall
- **Herbs & spices pack** (leaf/seed/bark/flower) and **fruits-by-cultivar** niceties
- **Curated Phase-2 derived foods** (`derived_foods.jsonl`): cheeses, yogurts, cultured dairy, etc.
- **Ranking polish**: BM25 weights, dedupe when TP name == taxon name (prefer TP)

---

## **CURRENT STATUS: FULLY WORKING** âœ…

### ðŸ”§ **Database Sync: WORKING**

The database sync mechanism is working correctly:

- âœ… `pnpm sync-db` copies ETL database to API database
- âœ… `pnpm etl:build:sync` builds and syncs in one command
- âœ… Auto-sync in API startup when `AUTO_COPY_ETL_DB=true`
- âœ… FTS tables properly copied with WAL/SHM files

### ðŸŽ¯ **FTS Search: WORKING**

- âœ… FTS-based search using `taxa_fts` and `tp_fts` tables
- âœ… Proper BM25 ranking across taxa and taxon+part results
- âœ… Optimized search response times
- âœ… Legacy unused FTS tables removed for cleaner schema

---

## **CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY STATUS**

**What's Working:**

- âœ… Search returns taxon+part results ("milk" â†’ "Cow Milk", "Sheep Milk")
- âœ… Implied parts working ("apple" â†’ "Apple (Fuji)", "Apple (Gala)")
- âœ… Name overrides working ("beef" â†’ "Beef" instead of "Cattle Muscle")
- âœ… UI displays and navigates correctly with "Food" badges
- âœ… Unified treatment of TX/TP/TPT as backend concepts

**What Was Fixed:**

- âœ… Database sync (FTS tables now properly copied from ETL to API database)
- âœ… FTS-based search performance (now using optimized FTS with BM25 ranking)
- âœ… Legacy FTS tables cleaned up (removed unused `taxon_doc_fts` and `nodes_fts_test`)

---

## **PHASE 2: TRANSFORM CHAINS (FUTURE)**

**Scope**: Materialize common derived foods as taxon+part+transform nodes

**Examples**:

- **Buttermilk**: `tp:...bos:taurus:part:milk` + `tf:churn`
- **Yogurt**: `tp:...bos:taurus:part:milk` + `tf:ferment{starter=yogurt_thermo}`
- **Skim Milk**: `tp:...bos:taurus:part:milk` + `tf:standardize_fat{fat_pct=0.5}`

**Status**: Not started - deferred to future ADR

---

## **SUCCESS METRICS**

**Current Status**: âœ… 100% complete

- âœ… 450+ taxon+part nodes materialized
- âœ… Search functionality working with FTS optimization
- âœ… UI integration complete
- âœ… Database sync working correctly
- âœ… Legacy FTS tables cleaned up

**Production Ready**:

- âœ… FTS-based search performance with BM25 ranking
- âœ… Robust database sync mechanism
- âœ… Clean schema with only active FTS tables
- âœ… Ready for production use
