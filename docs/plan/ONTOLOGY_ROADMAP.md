# Ontology & Data Roadmap

**Phase 0 — Tooling & Governance**
- NDJSON format, validator, diff tool, docs in repo.

**Phase 1 — Coverage**
- Pantry-100 + missing lineages for FDC Foundation 411.

**Phase 2 — Transforms & Attributes**
- Lock identity-bearing attributes and transform families.
- Add param schemas (ranges/enums) where needed.

**Phase 3 — Evidence & Canonicalization**
- Ingest FDC foundation → attach evidence at FoodState scope.
- Median/trimmed-mean rollups per node; provenance tables.

**Phase 4 — QA & Signals**
- Distance-based split candidates; outlier detection; sodium/water checks for canned vs raw, etc.

**Phase 5 — Recipes & Mixtures**
- Recipe graph (mixture/composition nodes), nested recipe support, yield handling, cooked mass change.
